@article{Kim2010,
abstract = {This paper describes a design of grid-simulator for an experiment of transient stability of grid-connected renewable energy system. A transient analysis of renewable energy system has been researched by a simulation, because a direct connection of renewable energy system to the real utility under transient grid conditions is dangerous and it is hard to produce the transient grid conditions with direct grid connection. If a grid-simulator is used in the transient stability experiment, the transient grid condition might be generated easily using reference data without any impact on the grid. A back-to-back converter was employed as a grid-simulator. The grid-simulator was designed by simulation with PSCAD/EMTDC. In order to confirm its physical operational characteristics, the grid-simulator was manufactured and its experiment results showed that the grid-simulator could generate transient grid conditions without any influence to the grid.},

abstract = {In this study, a grid simulator based on a back-to-back inverter topology with resonant controllers is presented. The simulator is able to generate three-phase voltages for a range of amplitudes and frequencies with different types of perturbations, such as voltage sags, steady-state unbalanced voltages, low-order harmonics and flicker. The aim of this equipment is to test the performance of a given system under such distorted voltages. A prototype of the simulator, consisting of two inverters connected back-to-back to a 380 V three-phase grid and feeding a micro-grid composed of two-inverter interfaced distributed generators and a critical load was built and tested. A set of experimental results for linear purely resistive loads, non-linear loads and current-controlled inverters is presented to prove the capabilities of the simulator. Finally, a case study is presented by testing a micro-grid. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The eGRID Center is collocated with the Wind Turbine Drivetrain Testing Facility (WTDTF) within the SCE{\&}G Energy Innovation Center at Clemson University's Restoration Institute in North Charleston, SC, USA. It will be demonstrated how the 15 MW Grid Simulator is able to be utilized in conjunction with either the 7.5 MW or the 15 MW wind turbine dynamometers within the WTDTF, or as a stand-alone test facility. The 15 MW Grid Simulator topology and technical details will be discussed as they relate to grid integration and performance evaluations of medium voltage, multi-megawatt equipment destined for the power system. The system topology consists of a unique combination of state-of-the-art power conversion equipment with passive reactive impedance divider circuits in order to provide a robust solution for fault ride-through evaluations while also having the accuracy and bandwidth to perform power quality evaluations and power hardware-in-the-loop experiments.},

abstract = {At a high level, the report concludes that as an electric system approaches a significant penetration in variable resources: Essential reliability services will be strained; Technical aspects of the evolving resource mix must be given due consideration at state, federal, and provincial levels; Solution sets for maintaining reliability can come from: Market tools and rules, New technology integration, and Standards or requirements; and Unresolved cost implications can impede solution sets. In summary, NERC recommends the following: NERC, state and provincial regulators, and industry should use an analytical basis for understanding potential reliability impacts as a result of increasing VERs and how those impacts can affect system configuration, composition, and essential reliability services. Based on analytical results and the broad experience of NERC stakeholders, specific recommendations for changes to operating and planning practices, state and provincial programs, and pertinent NERC Reliability Standards should be developed. Specific recommendations to date are provided in the NERC IVGTF reports listed in Appendix 2. VER issues can be addressed through many non-NERC avenues (e.g., market rules; vertically integrated operations; or federal, state, and provincial programs). However, it is recommended that NERC work with affected entities in the different NERC Regions, including state and provincial agencies that have jurisdiction over VERs, wholesale market areas, and vertically integrated utilities, to develop appropriate guidelines, practices, and requirements to address VER integration issues that impact the reliability of the BPS. CAISO recommendations are included throughout the report and are specific to the CAISO area. While these recommendations represent good industry practice in meeting reliability objectives, consideration of region-specific issues and tailored approaches will likely be needed as other areas observe increasing VER trends. Specific items for consideration include: Reactive power control Active power control Inertia and Frequency Response Steady-State, Short-Circuit, and Dynamic Generic Model Development},

abstract = {Europe celebrated last year (2008) the 100-year anniversary of the first liquefaction of helium by H. Kammerling Onnes in Leiden. It led to the discovery of superconductivity in 1911. Europe is still active in the development of superconducting (SC) devices. The discovery of high critical temperature materials in 1986, again in Europe, has opened a lot of opportunities for SC devices by broking the 4 K cryogenic bottleneck. Electric networks experience deep changes due to the emergence of dispersed generation (renewable among other) and to the advances in ICT (Information Communication Technologies). The networks of the future will be "smart grids". Superconductivity will offer "smart" devices for these grids like FCL (Fault Current Limiter) or VLI (Very Low Inductance) cable and would certainly play an important part. Superconductivity also will participate to the required sustainable development by lowering the losses and enhancing the mass specific powers. Different SC projects in Europe will be presented (Cable, FCL, SMES, Flywheel and Electrical Machine) but the description is not exhaustive. Nexans has commercialized the first two FCLs without public funds in the European grid (UK and Germany). The Amsterdam HTS cable is an exciting challenge in term of losses for long SC cables. European companies (Nexans, Air Liquide, Siemens, Converteam,...) are also very active for projects outside Europe (LIPA, DOE FCL,...). ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The main significance of the generator topology is that the relative position of the magnets, copper and steel has been chosen so that there are no magnetic attraction forces between the stator and permanent magnet translator. The lack of magnetic forces and the modular nature of the generator topology makes the manufacture and assembly of the generator easier than a conventional iron-cored permanent magnet linear generator. Analytical modelling techniques are described with a genetic algorithm optimization method. The proposed topology is implemented to Archimedes Wave Swing wave energy converter. A 50 kW prototype has been built to prove the concept and the no-load and load test results are presented.},

The effect of aggregated hourly demand (DR) response is considered as a means of mitigating transmis- sion violations when uncertainties are considered. The proposed mixed-integer programming (MIP) model applies the Monte Carlomethod for representing the hourly wind energy and system load forecast errors. A 6-bus, 118-bus, and the Northwest region of Turkish electric power network are considered to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed day-ahead stochastic scheduling method in power systems.},

abstract = {Frequency response, the response of the power system to large, sudden mismatches between generation and load, has recently been garnering a lot of attention across all four interconnections in North America. This study was specifically designed to investigate the frequency response of California due to large loss-of-generation events of the type targeted by NERC Standard BAL-003 – Frequency Response and Bias, under near future system conditions with high levels of wind and solar generation. While this study addresses the overall frequency response of the Western grid, it does not address any changes to the limits of stability-limited transmission paths that may be warranted at higher penetration of variable energy resources. For this work, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) created a number of credible loadflow and stability base cases that represent high penetration of wind and solar generation expected in California in the near future. These cases were deliberately selected with the expectation that they would represent some of the most challenging conditions for CAISO with respect to frequency response. The study primarily focused on two cases: A winter low-load and high-wind condition case, and a weekend morning high-wind and high-solar condition case. These cases represent different operating conditions with a large number of synchronous generators displaced by variable renewable energy resources. In addition, some of the thermal power plants with synchronous generators were also assumed to be retired due to once-through-cooling (OTC) regulation. At the snapshot of time represented in these cases, the fraction of California generation coming from wind and solar plants was 37{\%} (11 GW total) and 50{\%} (15 GW total), respectively. Most of the simulations focused on the trip of two units at the Palo Verde Nuclear Power Station. This 2690 MW event is the largest loss-of-generation event in WECC for which involuntary load shedding and other stability consequences must be avoided.},

abstract = {A concept is presented along with the overarching structure of the virtual power plant (VPP), the primary vehicle for delivering cost efficient integration of distributed energy resources (DER) into the existing power systems. The growing pressure, primarily driven by environmental concerns, for generating more electricity from renewables and improving energy efficiency have promoted the application of DER into electricity systems. So far, DER have been used to displace energy from conventional generating plants but not to displace their capacity as they are not visible to system operators. If this continues, this will lead to problematic over-capacity issues and under- utilisation of the assets, reduce overall system efficiency and eventually increase the electricity cost that needs to be paid by society. The concept of VPP was developed to enhance the visibility and control of DER to system operators and other market actors by providing an appropriate interface between these system components. The technical and commercial functionality facilitated through the VPP are described and concludes with case studies demonstrating the benefit of aggregation (VPP concept) and the use of the optimal power flow algorithm to characterise VPP.},

The main significance of the generator topology is that the relative position of the magnets, copper and steel has been chosen so that there are no magnetic attraction forces between the stator and permanent magnet translator. The magnetic force between magnets is reacted within a self supporting structure. The lack of magnetic forces and the modular nature of the generator topology makes the manufacture and assembly of the generator easier than a conventional iron-cored permanent magnet generator. Modeling techniques used to design the generator topology are described and photos are presented to demonstrate the benefits of the topology in terms of manufacture and assembly.},

abstract = {Renewable energy sources based on photovoltaic (PV) along with battery-based energy storage necessitate power conditioning to meet load requirements and/or be connected to the electrical grid. The power conditioning is achieved via a dc-dc converter and a DC-AC inverter stages to produce the desired AC source. This is also the case even when the load is of dc type, such as the typical portable electronic devices that require AC adaptors to be powered from the AC mains. The letter presents a hybrid PV-battery-powered dc bus system that eliminates the DC-AC conversion stage, resulting in lower cost and improved overall energy conversion efficiency. It is also shown experimentally that the switching ac adaptors associated with the various commonly used portable electronic devices can be reused with the proposed dc bus system. A novel high-gain hybrid boost-flyback converter is also introduced with several times higher voltage conversion ratio than the conventional boost converter topology. This arrangement results in higher DC bus levels and lower cable conduction losses. Moreover, the voltage stress on the hybrid boost-flyback converter power switch is within half the output voltage. Experimental results taken from a laboratory prototype are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed converter/system.},

abstract = {Increasing levels of wind generation has resulted in an urgent need for the assessment of their impact on frequency control of power systems. Whereas increased system inertia is intrinsically linked to the addition of synchronous generation to power systems, due to differing electromechanical characteristics, this inherent link is not present in wind turbine generators. Regardless of wind turbine technology, the displacement of conventional generation with wind will result in increased rates of change of system frequency. The magnitude of the frequency excursion following a loss of generation may also increase. Amendment of reserve policies or modification of wind turbine inertial response characteristics may be necessary to facilitate increased levels of wind generation. This is particularly true in small isolated power systems.},

abstract = {This paper investigates an improved active power control method for variable speed wind turbine to enhance the inertial response and damping capability during transient events. The optimized power point tracking (OPPT) controller, which shifts the turbine operating point from the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) curve to the virtual inertia control (VIC) curves according to the frequency deviation, is proposed to release the “hidden” kinetic energy and provide dynamic frequency support to the grid. The effects of the VIC on power oscillation damping capability are theoretically evaluated. Compared to the conventional supplementary derivative regulator-based inertia control, the proposed control scheme can not only provide fast inertial response, but also increase the system damping capability during transient events. Thus, inertial response and power oscillation damping function can be obtained in a single controller by the proposed OPPT control. A prototype three-machine system containing two synchronous generators and a PMSG-based wind turbine with 31{\%} of wind penetration is tested to validate the proposed control strategy on providing rapid inertial response and enhanced system damping.},

First, the analytical model of a multibrid wind turbine concept consisting of a single-stage gearbox and a three-phase radial-flux PM synchronous generator with a back-to-back power converter is presented. The design optimization is adopted with a genetic algorithm for minimizing generator system cost. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed electromagnetic design model, the optimization results of a 500-kW direct-drive PM generator and a 1.5-MW multibrid PM generator with various gear ratios are, respectively, compared with those from other methods. Then, the optimal design approach is further employed for a range from 750 kW up to 10 MW. The optimization results of PM generator systems including direct-drive and multibrid wind turbine configurations are obtained, and the suitable ranges of gear ratios for different power ratings are investigated. Finally, the detailed comparisons of the most cost-effective multibrid PM generator system and the optimized direct-drive PM generator system are also presented and discussed. The comparative results have shown that the multibrid wind turbine concept appears more cost-effective than the direct-drive concept.},

abstract = {An interconnected electric power system is a complex system that must be operated within a safe frequency range in order to reliably maintain the instantaneous balance between generation and load. This is accomplished by ensuring that adequate resources are available to respond to expected and unexpected imbalances and restoring frequency to its scheduled value in order to ensure uninterrupted electric service to customers. Electrical systems must be flexible enough to reliably operate under a variety of "change" scenarios. System planners and operators must understand how other parts of the system change in response to the initial change, and need tools to manage such changes to ensure reliable operation within the scheduled frequency range. This report presents a systematic approach to identifying metrics that are useful for operating and planning a reliable system with increased amounts of variable renewable generation which builds on existing industry practices for frequency control after unexpected loss of a large amount of generation. The report introduces a set of metrics or tools for measuring the adequacy of frequency response within an interconnection. Based on the concept of the frequency nadir, these metrics take advantage of new information gathering and processing capabilities that system operators are developing for wide-area situational awareness. Primary frequency response is the leading metric that will be used by this report to assess the adequacy of primary frequency control reserves necessary to ensure reliable operation. It measures what is needed to arrest frequency decline (i.e., to establish frequency nadir) at a frequency higher than the highest set point for under- frequency load shedding within an interconnection. These metrics can be used to guide the reliable operation of an interconnection under changing circumstances.},

The main contribution of this paper is summarized as 1) Design of a network based control scheme for inverter based sources, which provides proper current control during grid connected mode and voltage control during islanding mode. 2) Development of an algorithm for intentional islanding detection and synchronization controller required during grid reconnection. 3) Dynamic modeling and simulation are conducted to show system behavior under proposed method using SIMULINK. From the simulation results using Simulink dynamic models, it can be shown that these controllers provide the microgrid with a deterministic and reliable connection to the grid.},

Given that all systems are interconnected through their transformers, such overvoltages affect not only to the low voltage equipment, but to the medium or high voltage grid. The phenomenon is related to the interaction among the inverters until the anti-islanding protection trips. It must be pointed out that these islanding conditions are not considered in any standard. In any event, the problem is not the islanding detection, whose procedures are usually focused on a reliable detection when generation and consumption are balanced. The circumstances in which the overvoltage appears are the opposite, with a generation much higher than the load. Since standards are not applicable, it has been necessary to investigate this phenomenon in the field, testing several inverters in different solar plants. Several inverters, from different manufacturers, have been tested in wide-scale photovoltaic systems. The overvoltages, as well as the damages in meters, have been reproduced and recorded. This paper will present this new kind of overvoltage, specific of photovoltaic systems. The findings will be based on actual measurements in several wide-scale photovoltaic plants. Inverters used in solar plants behave as current sources, so they increase or decrease the voltage whatever is necessary to achieve the required current. It is this characteristic what creates an overvoltage when the net- work changes, reducing the load dramatically.},

abstract = {This paper presents a coordinated voltage control scheme (CVCS) for a cluster of offshore wind power plants (OWPPs) connected to a VSC HVDC system. The primary control point of the proposed voltage control scheme is the introduced Pilot bus, which is having the highest short circuit capacity in the offshore AC grid. The developed CVCS comprehends an optimization algorithm, aiming for minimum active power losses in the offshore grid, to generate voltage reference to the Pilot bus. During steady state operation, the Pilot bus voltage is controlled by dispatching reactive power references to each wind turbine (WT) in the WPP cluster based on their available reactive power margin and network sensitivity based participation factors, which are derived from the dV/dQ sensitivity of a WT bus w.r.t the Pilot bus. This method leads to minimization of the risk of undesired effects, particularly overvoltage at the terminals of the WT located far away from the AC collector substation, by dispatching lower reactive power references compared to the ones nearer to the substation. In addition, the paper proposes a control strategy for improved voltage ride through capability of WTs for faults in the offshore grid, thus leading to improved dynamic voltage profile in the offshore AC grid.},

Because a high penetration of renewable energy sources weakens the correlation between wholesale electricity prices and network demand, cost-minimizing electric vehicles may cause high peaks in network load. Managing congestion is not costly in theory but difficult to implement efficiently. Grid tariffs that are fixed ex ante, based on network load, were found to make the problem worse compared to the base-case scenario of flat tariffs. An optimal dynamic grid tariff yields desirable outcomes but is difficult to determine in case of realistic forecasting uncertainties. An iterative approach of a distribution grid capacity market has practical barriers related to IT infrastructure and computational requirements. Advance capacity allocation is more straightforward to implement, but the inter-temporal constraints of the electric vehicles continue to pose a challenge.},

abstract = {Wind power is an essential part of the strategy to address challenges facing the energy sector. Operation of the electricity network in 2020 will require higher levels of response and reserve from generation. The provision of inertial response from wind turbines was investigated. A model was developed for the simulation of frequency on the mainland UK system, including a simplified model for a synchronous generator to represent Full Power Converter turbines. Two different methods of inertia response, the step method and the inertia coupling method, were modelled and introduced into the turbine torque speed control. Simulations illustrated the effects on primary frequency control for a high penetration of wind turbines. Results are shown for different demand levels with generation losses of 1320GW and 1800GW. A comparison of the inertia functions is included and the effect of wind speed and the constant speed region of the maximum power extraction curve. For the scenarios modelled only a small change in turbine output was required for inertia response (0.02p.u). Without inertia response a large increase in synchronous plant response was needed. A test rig was constructed consisting of a Full Power Converter bridge and a synchronous generator driven by a dc machine. Power converters were designed and constructed by the candidate. Vector control of both the generator converter and grid converter was implemented on a dedicated control platform. The inertia coupling function was implemented and a test frequency deviation injected to represent a load generation imbalance. Results compared closely to those from the model and demonstrated the capability to closely couple turbine speed to system frequency with adjustment of the response via a filter if desired. The experimental work confirmed the adequacy of the simplified generator model and further confirmed the possibility of using inertia response.},

To create the model, we obtained some broad design information from the published documents of turbine manufacturers, with a heavy emphasis on the REpower 5M machine. Because detailed data was unavailable, however, we also used the publicly available properties from the conceptual models in the WindPACT, RECOFF, and DOWEC projects. We then created a composite from these data, extracting the best available and most representative specifications. This report documents the specifications of the NREL offshore 5-MW baseline wind turbine—including the aerodynamic, structural, and control-system properties—and the rationale behind its development. The model has been, and will likely continue to be, used as a reference by research teams throughout the world to standardize baseline offshore wind turbine specifications and to quantify the benefits of advanced land- and sea-based wind energy technologies.},

Distributed power generation systems (DPGSs) based on renewable energy sources experience a large development worldwide, with Germany, Denmark, Japan, and USA as leaders in the development in this field. Due to the increasing number of DPGSs connected to the utility network, new and stricter standards in respect to power quality, safe running, and islanding protection are issued. As a consequence, the control of distributed generation systems should be improved to meet the requirements for grid interconnection. This paper gives an overview of the structures for the DPGS based on fuel cell, photovoltaic, and wind turbines. In addition, control structures of the grid-side converter are presented, and the possibility of compensation for low-order harmonics is also discussed. Moreover, control strategies when running on grid faults are treated. This paper ends up with an overview of synchronization methods and a discussion about their importance in the control},

However, this approach requires long sampling and computation periods. In this study, a novel speed and position estimation method, based on identification of rotor slot harmonics that does not require any kind of spectral analysis is proposed. The required information is extracted by demodulating the information available in an external search coil (or in phase current). The algorithm used for this purpose is fast and can be applied within a typical control cycle of a vector controlled drive algorithm. In the application of the method here, higher order rotor slot harmonics have been utilized. In this manner, the position estimation resolution increases and also possible effect of harmonics stemming from other sources are avoided. The approach is explained in the paper and illustrated with experimental results.},

abstract = {When the wind power accounts for a large portion of the grid power, it may need to help the grid voltage and frequency regulation. This paper investigates a permanent-magnet wind generator with a full power voltage-source converter in weak-grid mode, where the DC-link voltage needs to be controlled from the generator side instead of the grid side. The energy relationship of the wind generator, DC-link energy storage, and load is established. An intrinsic right-half-plane zero, together with the wind power characteristics, the mechanical system inertia, and the DC-link energy storage, is identified as the physical limitations for the control. With the understanding of the system energy relationship and limitations, a hybrid adaptive control algorithm is proposed that searches for the optimal generator acceleration to achieve the maximum wind generator power change rate to match the load power variation. The proposed control scheme is verified through simulation of a 1.5-MW wind system as well as through the experiment of a scaled 1-kW, DSP-/field-programmable-gate-array-controlled, permanent-magnet-generator-based test bed. The results show that it is feasible to regulate DC link by the generator-side converter through the generator speed control. Some important applications issues are also investigated, including the DC-link energy storage requirement, wind speed change impact, and control transition between the weak-grid and strong-grid modes.},

abstract = {A model predictive control (MPC) is proposed for two three-to-single-phase matrix converters (MC) in back-to-back connection based solid state transformer (SST). The MC-SST system presents single-stage ac-ac conversion, reduced transformer volume and weight compared to using the conventional line-frequency transformer, and smart transmission capability due to the controllable voltage amplitude and frequency. However, the existing modulation methods contain sophisticated voltage and current vectors computation and duty cycle composition, which could make the control of the proposed topology too complex. In this paper, it is decided to use easy to perform MPC for the whole scheme. The proposed MPC predicts the circuit variables based on the discrete model of MC-SST system, and evaluates a cost function that ensures closest value to the current reference of ac outputs. The best switching state is selected to drive the power devices in the next sampling period. Simulation studies carried out on different voltage amplitude and frequency between ac inputs and outputs, as well as load power variations demonstrated the effectiveness and simplicity of the proposed MPC for the MC-SST.},

abstract = {The inertia of a power system is a key factor in determining the initial frequency decline after a disturbance. Low system inertia can allow large frequency declines to occur that could lead to violation of frequency security limits, particularly in smaller power systems, or play a key role in allowing cascading outages to occur. Future developments in power systems will mean that the system inertia will become highly variable and take values that would traditionally have been considered very low. Presented is a method for the robust estimation of the generator inertia available in the system during a disturbance. This method has been validated using simulations of the IEEE 39-bus system in DIgSILENTTM PowerFactory{\textregistered}. Inertia estimates for a variety of disturbance types and noise conditions have been made, and found to have a median error of 1.53{\%} with inter-quartile range of 6.6{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

The understanding of power quality elements is highlighted. The events of neutral to ground voltage disturbance are analysed by using CBEMA Curve. The events of neutral to ground voltage which occur outside the CBEMA Curve will easily contribute the above power quality problems. By implementing a proper grounding arrangement system based on TT, TN-S and TN-C-S systems and applying a separately derived system, the problems can be mitigated. With adequate wiring and proper grounding installation and by adding a separately derived source near to the load will eliminate the high neutral to ground voltage events.},

abstract = {A novel procedure for estimating the total inertia of the Great Britain (GB) power system is presented. Following an instantaneous in-feed loss, regional variations in the estimate of inertia are obtained from measured frequency transients using installed synchronised phasor measurement units (PMUs). A method is proposed to first detect a suitable event for analysis, and then filter the measured transients in order to obtain a reliable estimate of inertia for a given region of the GB network. The total inertia for the whole system is then calculated as a summation, with an estimate also provided as to the contribution to inertia from residual sources, namely synchronously connected demand and embedded generation. The approach is first demonstrated on the full dynamic model of the GB transmission system, before results are presented from analyzing the impact of a number of instantaneous transmission in-feed loss events using phase-angle data provided by PMUs from the GB transmission network and also devices installed at the domestic supply at 4 GB universities.},

Owing to the rapid increase of wind power plants comprising large number of wind turbines, parameters and models to represent each individual wind turbine in detail makes it necessary to develop aggregated wind power plant models considering the simulation time for power system stability studies. In this paper, aggregated wind power plant models consisting of the IEC 61400-27 variable speed wind turbine models (type 3 and type 4) with a power plant controller is presented. The performance of the detailed benchmark wind power plant model and the aggregated model are compared by means of simulations for the specified test cases. Consequently, the results are summarized and discussed in terms of model accuracy, simulation time and modeling assumptions.},

abstract = {Future power systems could benefit considerably from having a continuous real-time estimate of system inertia. If realized, this could provide reference inputs to proactive control and protection systems which could enhance not only system stability but also operational economics through, for example, more informed ancillary reserve planning using knowledge of prevailing system conditions and stability margins. Performing these predictions in real time is a significant challenge owing to the complex stochastic and temporal relationships between available measurements. This paper proposes a statistical model capable of estimating system inertia in real time through observed steady-state and relatively small frequency variations; it is trained to learn the features that inter-relate steady-state averaged frequency variations and system inertia, using historical system data demonstrated over two consecutive years. The proposed algorithm is formulated as a Gaussian Mixture Model with temporal dependence encoded as Markov chains. Applied to the U.K. power system, it produces an optimized mean squared error within 0.1 s 2 for 95{\%} of the daily estimation if being calibrated on a half-hourly basis and maintains robustness through measurement interruptions of up to a period of two hours.},

Then, possible future generator systems are reviewed. Hydraulic transmissions are significantly lighter than gearboxes and enable continuously variable transmission, but their efficiency is lower. A brushless DFIG is a medium speed generator without brushes and with improved low-voltage ride-through characteristics compared with the DFIG. Magnetic pseudo DDs are smaller and lighter than DD generators, but need a sufficiently low and stable magnet price to be successful. In addition, superconducting generators can be smaller and lighter than normal DD generators, but both cost and reliability need experimental demonstration.

One of the challenges is the voltage rise issue as a part of the steady-state analysis of DGs during planning and operational stages. This issue should be analyzed in order to determine the hosting capacity of distribution feeders in the first instance. Accordingly, Turkey is a promising candidate to integrate high penetration of DGs and has recently started to publish regulations for DGs. This paper presents a method to calculate DG hosting capacity of MV distribution feeders in Turkey. The presented calculation is compared with the current regulations in terms of load flow results. Additionally, this paper aims to ease the technical reviews of the DG integration with the presented method, which helps to assess the steady-state voltage impacts introduced by DGs. Finally, a general flow chart of steady-state analysis is proposed for Turkish DSOs.},

abstract = {The use of distributed energy resources is increas- ingly being pursued as a supplement and an alternative to large conventional central power stations. The specification of a power- electronic interface is subject to requirements related not only to the renewable energy source itself but also to its effects on the power-system operation, especially where the intermittent energy source constitutes a significant part of the total system capacity. In this paper, new trends in power electronics for the integration of wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generators are presented. A review of the appropriate storage-system technology used for the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources is also introduced. Discussions about common and future trends in re- newable energy systems based on reliability and maturity of each technology are presented.

The DC-link voltage can be controlled at the machine-side converter (MSC), while the grid-side converter (GSC) controls the grid active power for a maximum power point tracking (MPPT). At the grid fault condition, the DC-link voltage controller is designed using a feedback linearization (FL) theory. For the MPPT, a proportional control loop is added to the torque control to reduce the influence of the inertia moment in the wind turbines, which can improve its dynamic performance. The validity of this control algorithm has been verified by the simulation of the 2-MW PMSG wind turbine system.},

abstract = {This paper presents observations of real time frequency transients of
Bangladesh Power System (BPS) including last country-wide blackout on
1st November, 2014 after HVDC station tripped with respect to frequency
control and primary focus on Inertial Frequency Response. The inertia
constant of a system describes the initial, transient, frequency
behavior of a system when subjected to a real power disturbance.
Therefore, the inertia constant of a system can be a useful tool when
investigating the frequency stability of a system. The frequency
transients of power system is a significant index for power system
operation and research on the dynamic frequency characteristic of power
system is the basis of many important design works such as the design of
under frequency load shedding scheme. Therefore, it is of great urgency
and necessity to analysis the dynamic frequency characteristic of BPS
before countrywide blackout after disturbance. This paper first analysis
two real time frequency transients those have almost similar
predisturbance network condition and secondly shows that maintaining
minimum level of Inertial reserve in real-time operations with unit
commitment can be crucial to ensure stable, secure and reliable
operation of BPS. Beside this under frequency scheme should be revised
and controlled BPS network disintegration along with rate of change of
frequency should be adopted for adaptive as well as self-healing of BPS.
This paper also focus on adaptive central under frequency and under
voltage load shed scheme (UFVLS) rather than discrete under frequency
load shed (UFLS).},

abstract = {Wind power is still the most promising renewable energy in the year of 2013. The wind turbine system (WTS) started with a few tens of kilowatt power in the 1980s. Now, multimegawatt wind turbines are widely installed even up to 6-8 MW. There is a widespread use of wind turbines in the distribution networks and more and more wind power stations, acting as power plants, are connected directly to the transmission networks. As the grid penetration and power level of the wind turbines increase steadily, the wind power starts to have significant impacts to the power grid system. Therefore, more advanced generators, power electronic systems, and control solutions have to be introduced to improve the characteristics of the wind power plant and make it more suitable to be integrated into the power grid. Meanwhile, there are also some emerging technology challenges, which need to be further clarified and investigated. This paper gives an overview and discusses some development trends in the technologies used for wind power systems. First, the developments of technology and market are generally discussed. Next, several state-of-the-art wind turbine concepts, as well as the corresponding power electronic converters and control structures, are reviewed, respectively. Furthermore, grid requirements and the technology challenges for the future WTS are also addressed.},

abstract = {A concept is presented along with the overarching structure of the virtual power plant (VPP), the primary vehicle for delivering cost efficient integration of distributed energy resources (DER) into the existing power systems. The growing pressure, primarily driven by environmental concerns, for generating more electricity from renewables and improving energy efficiency have promoted the application of DER into electricity systems. So far, DER have been used to displace energy from conventional generating plants but not to displace their capacity as they are not visible to system operators. If this continues, this will lead to problematic over-capacity issues and under- utilisation of the assets, reduce overall system efficiency and eventually increase the electricity cost that needs to be paid by society. The concept of VPP was developed to enhance the visibility and control of DER to system operators and other market actors by providing an appropriate interface between these system components. The technical and commercial functionality facilitated through the VPP are described and concludes with case studies demonstrating the benefit of aggregation (VPP concept) and the use of the optimal power flow algorithm to characterise VPP.},

abstract = {Several smart grid applications have recently been devised in order to timely perform supervisory functions along with self-healing and adaptive countermeasures based on system-wide analysis, with the ultimate goal of reducing the risks associated with potentially insecure operating conditions. Real-time transient stability assessment (TSA) belongs to this type of applications, which allows deciding and coordinating pertinent corrective control actions depending on the evolution of post-fault rotor-angle deviations. This study presents a novel approach for carrying out real-time TSA based on prediction of area-based centre-of-inertia (COI) referred rotor angles from phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements. Monte Carlo-based procedures are performed to iteratively evaluate the system transient stability response, considering the operational statistics related to loading condition changes and fault occurrence rates, in order to build a knowledge database for PMU and COI-referred rotor-angles as well as to screen those relevant PMU signals that allows ensuring high observability of slow and fast dynamic phenomena. The database is employed for structuring and training an intelligent COI-referred rotor-angle regressor based on support vector machines [support vector regressor (SVR)] to be used for real-time TSA from selected PMUs. Besides, the SVR is optimally tuned by using the swarm variant of the mean-variance mapping optimisation. The proposal is tested on the IEEE New England 39-bus system. Results demonstrate the feasibility of the methodology in estimating the COI-referred rotor angles, which enables alerting about real-time transient stability threats per system areas, for which a transient stability index is also computed.},

The SST consists of a cascaded multilevel ac/dc rectifier stage, a dual active bridge (DAB) converter stage with high-frequency transformers to provide a regulated 400-V dc distribution, and an optional dc/ac stage that can be connected to the 400-V dc bus to provide residential 120/240 V {\_}{\{}rm ac{\}}. However, due to dc-link voltage and power unbalance in the cascaded modules, the unbalanced dc-link voltages and power increase the stress of the semiconductor devices and cause overvoltage or overcurrent issues. This paper proposes a new voltage and power balance control for the cascaded H-Bridge converter-based SST. Based on the single-phase dq model, a novel voltage and the power control strategy is proposed to balance the rectifier capacitor voltages and the real power through parallel DAB modules. Furthermore, the intrinsic power constraints of the cascaded H-Bridge voltage balance control are derived and analyzed. With the proposed control methods, the dc-link voltage and the real power through each module can be balanced. The SST switching model simulation and the prototype experiments are presented to verify the performance of the proposed voltage and power balance controller.},

Indeed, the main and attractive features of high-order sliding modes are robustness against external disturbances, the grids faults in particular, and chattering-free behavior (no extra mechanical stress on the wind turbine drive train).

A possible solution is to use an approach that estimate BP based on pulse transit time. Since the method requires information collected from sensors placed at various body locations, a network could be setup to connect the different sensors effectively and securely. In this paper, we propose using multiple modes of communication, including communication via wired, wireless and/or biological channels (bio-channels) of the human body, to network the various sensors, i.e. the idea of hybrid body sensor network (h-BSN). Preliminary results show that h-BSN is potentially useful for monitoring BP over extensive periods of time and the idea can be extended to other applications that employ multiple on-body or in-body sensors.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design of new high-frequency transformer isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter modules connected in input-series-output-parallel (ISOP) for 20-kVA-solid-state transformer. The ISOP modular structure enables the use of low-voltage MOSFETs, featuring low on-state resistance and resulted conduction losses, to address medium-voltage input. A phase-shift dual-half-bridge (DHB) converter is employed to achieve high-frequency galvanic isolation, bidirectional power flow, and zero voltage switching (ZVS) of all switching devices, which leads to low switching losses even with high-frequency operation. Furthermore, an adaptive inductor is proposed as the main energy transfer element of a phase-shift DHB converter so that the circulating energy can be optimized to maintain ZVS at light load and minimize the conduction losses at heavy load as well. As a result, high efficiency over wide load range and high power density can be achieved. In addition, current stress of switching devices can be reduced. A planar transformer adopting printed-circuit-board windings arranged in an interleaved structure is designed to obtain low core and winding loss, solid isolation, and identical parameters in multiple modules. Moreover, the modular structure along with a distributed control provides plug-and-play capability and possible high-level fault tolerance. The experimental results on 1 kW DHB converter modules switching at 50 kHz are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.},

abstract = {Galvanic isolation in grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) microinverters is a very important feature concerning power quality and safety issues. However, high-frequency transformers and high switching losses degrade the efficiency of the isolated types of microinverters. Recently, several isolated topologies were proposed to increase the efficiency and lifetime of PV converters. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the most recent isolated topologies of PV microinverters. These topologies are categorized into two groups in terms of their power processing stages: 1) single-stage microinverter and 2) multi-stage microinverter. Various topologies are presented, compared, and scrutinized in terms of the power losses at different stages, control techniques, position of the decoupling capacitor, and cost analysis. Recommendations are provided to improve the existing topologies and select the suitable control techniques to obtain a clear picture of the framework for next-generation isolated PV microinverters.},

@article{Morren2006a,
abstract = {The increasing penetration of variable speed wind turbines in the electricity grid will result in a reduction of the number of connected conventional power plants. This will lead to a reduction of inertia in the grid, as the rotational speed of a variable speed turbine and the grid are decoupled by a power electronic converter. A lower system inertia will result in larger and faster frequency deviations after occurrence of abrupt variations in generation and load. It is possible to implement an additional control loop in the power electronic converter of the turbine, which connects the turbine inertia directly to the grid. It is even possible, by control, to make a 'virtual inertia' that is larger than the real inertia. During a frequency drop additional power can be released to the grid with this control. This behaviour will be called inertial response. The additional power is obtained from the kinetic energy that is stored in the rotating mass of the turbine. In this contribution two different control strategies are investigated and compared with each other. A type of control that is equal to the primary frequency control of large power plants shows the best results, both with respect to the power that is needed to limit the frequency drop and with respect to electrical and mechanical stress of the turbine. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {To support concept studies aimed at assessing offshore wind technology, we developed the specifications of a representative utility-scale multimegawatt turbine now known as the “NREL offshore 5-MW baseline wind turbine.” This wind turbine is a conventional three-bladed upwind variable-speed variable blade-pitch-to-feather-controlled turbine. To create the model, we obtained some broad design information from the published documents of turbine manufacturers, with a heavy emphasis on the REpower 5M machine. Because detailed data was unavailable, however, we also used the publicly available properties from the conceptual models in the WindPACT, RECOFF, and DOWEC projects. We then created a composite from these data, extracting the best available and most representative specifications. This report documents the specifications of the NREL offshore 5-MW baseline wind turbine—including the aerodynamic, structural, and control-system properties—and the rationale behind its development. The model has been, and will likely continue to be, used as a reference by research teams throughout the world to standardize baseline offshore wind turbine specifications and to quantify the benefits of advanced land- and sea-based wind energy technologies.},

@article{Keysan2014,
abstract = {This thesis describes four novel superconducting machine concepts, in the pursuit of finding a suitable design for large offshore wind turbines. The designs should be reliable, modular and light-weight. The main novelty of the topologies reside in using a single loop shaped stationary superconducting field winding, which eliminates the rotating transfer couplers and electric brushes or brushless exciters. Furthermore, the electromagnetic forces in the superconducting wire are also eliminated, which simplifies the design and manufacturing of the cryostat and the support structure. Among the four topologies presented, the claw pole type machine is the most promising one. The rotor of the machine composes of claw-poles made from laminated electrical sheets, the superconducting field winding and the armature winding are stationary. The machine is analysed using 3D FEA simulations and a small linear machine prototype is manufactured to verify the simulations. For large scale applications, a double-sided claw pole machine is proposed, which has balanced magnetic attraction forces in the rotor. The machine has a modular cryostat structure, which increases the availability of the machine. Thus, even if a fault occurs in the cryocoolers or in the armature coils, the rest of the machine can operate at partial load until the maintenance is performed. Moreover, it is much easier to replace the faulty parts, as full disassemble of the machine is not required, and a small on- site crane can be used. As a result, it offers operational advantages over the existing superconducting topologies. A 10 MW, 10 rpm generator design is presented, which has a diameter of 6.6 m and an axial length of 1.4 m. The total active mass of the generator is 58 tonnes, and the structural mass is 126 tonnes, which gives a total mass of 184 tonnes. There are four independent cryostats and two independent armature windings in the machine to improve modularity. The biggest advantage of the design is the significantly less superconducting wire usage compared to any other designs; 10 MW machine just needs 15 km of MgB2 wire at 30 K. Thus, it is believed that the proposed topology is a very cost effective and suitable candidate for a successful entry to the wind turbine market.},

abstract = {Numerical modeling of superconductors is widely recognized as a powerful tool for interpreting experimental results, understanding physical mechanisms, and predicting the performance of high-temperature-superconductor (HTS) tapes, wires, and devices. This is particularly true for ac loss calculation since a sufficiently low ac loss value is imperative to make these materials attractive for commercialization. In recent years, a large variety of numerical models, which are based on different techniques and implementations, has been proposed by researchers around the world, with the purpose of being able to estimate ac losses in HTSs quickly and accurately. This paper presents a literature review of the methods for computing ac losses in HTS tapes, wires, and devices. Technical superconductors have a relatively complex geometry (filaments, which might be twisted or transposed, or layers) and consist of different materials. As a result, different loss contributions exist. In this paper, we describe the ways of computing such loss contributions, which include hysteresis losses, eddy-current losses, coupling losses, and losses in ferromagnetic materials. We also provide an estimation of the losses occurring in a variety of power applications.},

abstract = {We have examined the potential of 10 MW superconducting direct drive generators to enter the European offshore wind power market and estimated that the production of about 1200 superconducting turbines until 2030 would correspond to 10{\%} of the EU offshore market. The expected properties of future offshore turbines of 8 and 10 MW have been determined from an up-scaling of an existing 5 MW turbine and the necessary properties of the superconducting drive train are discussed. We have found that the absence of the gear box is the main benefit and the reduced weight and size is secondary. However, the main challenge of the superconducting direct drive technology is to prove that the reliability is superior to the alternative drive trains based on gearboxes or permanent magnets. A strategy of successive testing of superconducting direct drive trains in real wind turbines of 10 kW, 100 kW, 1 MW and 10 MW is suggested to secure the accumulation of reliability experience. Finally, the quantities of high temperature superconducting tape needed for a 10 kW and an extreme high field 10 MW generator are found to be 7.5 km and 1500 km, respectively. A more realistic estimate is 200–300 km of tape per 10 MW generator and it is concluded that the present production capacity of coated conductors must be increased by a factor of 36 by 2020, resulting in a ten times lower price of the tape in order to reach a realistic price level for the superconducting drive train.},

abstract = {The solid-state transformer (SST) is one of the key elements in power electronic-based microgrid systems. The single-phase SST consists of a modular multilevel ac{\&}{\#}x2013;dc rectifier, a modular dual active bridge (DAB) dc{\&}{\#}x2013;dc converter with high-frequency transformers, and a dc{\&}{\#}x2013;ac inverter stage. However, due to dc bus voltage and power unbalancing in each module, the modular SST often presents instability problems making its design difficult and causing unpredictable behavior. Moreover, the unbalanced dc-link voltages increase the stress of the semiconductor devices, and also cause high harmonic distortions of grid current, therefore, necessitating the use of a bigger ac filter. This paper presents a novel single-phase d{\&}{\#}x2013;q vector-based common-duty-ratio control method for the multilevel rectifier, and a voltage feedforward and feedback based controller for the modular DAB converter. With the proposed control methods, the dc-link voltage and power in each module can be balanced. In addition, the low-distortion grid current, unity power factor, and bidirectional power flow can be achieved. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed control methods.},

A polynomial approximation with respect to time is applied to the waveform of the transients in estimating the inertia constant, and a simple model based on the idea of average system frequency is assumed in estimating the capacity of the generators. Results of the estimation using the transients at 10 events show that the inertia constant of the 60 Hz power system of Japan is around 14 to 18 seconds in the system load base, and the capacity of the spinning-reserve support generators is 20 to 40{\%} of the system load. The proposed procedure is expected to be tested by Kansai Electric Power Company with increased number of events. This effort will contribute to estimate and evaluate the dynamic behavior of the system frequency in loss of generation or load},

abstract = {Adequate contact pressure needs to be applied at electrical contacts to overcome contact separation force due to current constriction effects. In the railgun operation, the initial contact pressure is provided by the interference pressure between the armature and the rail. As the magnetic field is established in the bore, the electromagnetic force provides the contact pressure, as the initial contact pressure reduces due to wear or contact melting. Excessive initial contact pressure may delay the motion of the armature and cause overheating of the armature. On the other hand, insufficient initial pressure would result in contact separation of armature and rail. The contact interface is never perfectly smooth. It only contacts at discrete asperities at micro scale and at discrete points due to deformation of the contact interface at macro scale. The interface characteristics are different from the bulk behavior. A detailed model of contact resistivity is essential to compute the interfacial current density and temperature distributions accurately. A contact resistivity model was developed that is a function of contact pressure, the hardness of the softer contact member, average bulk resistivity, and contact constants. The model was implemented into the code EMAP3D. This paper presents the simulation results of the start-up of a sample railgun with and without contact resistivity.},

abstract = {Smart grids are often analyzed using a top-down approach, i.e., starting from communication and control technologies evolution, to then focus on their effects on active and passive users, in terms of new services, higher efficiency and quality of supply. However, with their bottom-up approach, virtual power plants (VPP) are very promising instruments for promoting an effective integration of distributed generation (DG) and energy storage devices as well as valid means for enabling consumers to respond to load management signals, when operated under the supervision of a scheduling coordinator. These aggregation factors can be very profitable for the distributed energy resources (DERs) economy and for the energy network itself. This paper presents a new algorithm to optimize the day-ahead thermal and electrical scheduling of a large scale VPP (LSVPP) which contains: a) many small-scale producers and consumers (“prosumers”) distributed over a large territory and b) energy storage and cogeneration processes. The algorithm also takes into account the actual location of each DER in the public network and their specific capability. Thermal and electrical generator models, load and storage devices are very detailed and flexible, as are the rates and incentives framework. Several novelties, with respect to the previous literature, are proposed. Case study results are also described and discussed},

Then, possible future generator systems are reviewed. Hydraulic transmissions are significantly lighter than gearboxes and enable continuously variable transmission, but their efficiency is lower. A brushless DFIG is a medium speed generator without brushes and with improved low-voltage ride-through characteristics compared with the DFIG. Magnetic pseudo DDs are smaller and lighter than DD generators, but need a sufficiently low and stable magnet price to be successful. In addition, superconducting generators can be smaller and lighter than normal DD generators, but both cost and reliability need experimental demonstration.

The system with two different LCL filters is considered, one with the iron core inductors and the other with the air core inductors. In that way the influence of the iron losses on the system stability is investigated. It is shown that the stability margins obtained by means of the nonlinear model simulation are somewhat wider than the ones obtained by the root locus technique.

abstract = {This thesis presents an investigation of how a direct-driven wind turbine generator should be designed and how small and efficient such a generator will be. Advantages and disadvantages of various types of direct-driven wind turbine generators are discussed, and a radial-flux permanent-magnet generator connected to a forced-commutated rectifier is chosen for a detailed theoretical investigation. Further, a design method is developed for the electromagnetic part of the chosen generator type. The generator is optimized with a simplified cost function which, besides including the cost of the active generator parts and the cost of the structure, also includes the cost of the average losses. Therefore, a method to calculate the average losses is derived. The design method is used to investigate the optimization of a 500 kW generator, and the size, efficiency and active weight of optimized generators from 30 kW to 3 MW are presented. A result of the investigation is that the outer diameters of the direct-driven generators are only slightly larger than the width of conventional wind energy converter nacelles. A comparison of average efficiency shows that direct-driven generators, including the losses in the frequency converters, are more efficient than conventional wind energy converter drive trains. Compared with other direct-driven generators, the proposed generator type is small, mainly because of the forced- commutated rectifier and because the generator is not required to produce a pull-out torque higher than the rated torque.},

abstract = {Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques are used in photovoltaic (PV) systems to maximize the PV array output power by tracking continuously the maximum power point (MPP) which depends on panels temperature and on irradiance conditions. The issue of MPPT has been addressed in different ways in the literature but, especially for low-cost implementations, the perturb and observe (P{\&}O) maximum power point tracking algorithm is the most commonly used method due to its ease of implementation. A drawback of P{\&}O is that, at steady state, the operating point oscillates around the MPP giving rise to the waste of some amount of available energy; moreover, it is well known that the P{\&}O algorithm can be confused during those time intervals characterized by rapidly changing atmospheric conditions. In this paper it is shown that, in order to limit the negative effects associated to the above drawbacks, the P{\&}O MPPT parameters must be customized to the dynamic behavior of the specific converter adopted. A theoretical analysis allowing the optimal choice of such parameters is also carried out. Results of experimental measurements are in agreement with the predictions of theoretical analysis.},

abstract = {—In modern industrial environment, the demand for condition monitoring and maintenance management for the in-duction motor has increased. Among all the components of the induction motor, bearing is the critical component and the fault occurring in it has to be considered as a major issue. Usually, the bearing fault can be detected by the vibrational analysis. However, this method has a disadvantage that location of the equipment is not always easily accessible, and also it is quite costly. Thus, in this paper, an experiment for detecting the fault in the bearing of a three phase induction motor is achieved by the frequency selec-tion in the stator-current spectrum. Their feature was evaluated by the fast Fourier transform and the diagnosis was performed by a support vector machine. Experimental results were obtained considering two types of outer raceway bearing faults at different load conditions and promising results were obtained.},

The purpose of the study was to investigate the thermal behaviour of the stratified tank system when subjected to constant temperature charging and constant volume hourly draws. The experimental setup consisted of a charge loop to simulate a solar collector input, three commercially available 270. L domestic hot water tanks and three side-arm, natural convection heat exchangers. Tests were performed over 8. h periods for three different plumbing configurations and two different hourly draw volumes. Simulations were conducted using the TRNSYS simulation environment, and the results showed that the TRNSYS model was in good agreement with the experimental results, where the discrepancies between data were found mainly in the regions of high temperature gradients within the storage tanks. Preliminary simulations were also conducted using realistic charge and draw profiles to illustrate the thermal behaviour of the tanks under non-ideal operating conditions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Many demand response resources are technically capable of providing ancillary services. In some cases, they can provide superior response to generators, as the curtailment of load is typically much faster than ramping thermal and hydropower plants. Analysis and quantification of demand response resources providing ancillary services is necessary to understand the resources' economic value and impact on the power system. Methodologies used to study grid integration of variable generation can be adapted to the study of demand response. In the present work, we describe and implement a methodology to construct detailed temporal and spatial representations of demand response resources and to incorporate those resources into power system models. In addition, the paper outlines ways to evaluate barriers to implementation. We demonstrate how the combination of these three analyses can be used to assess economic value of the realizable potential of demand response for ancillary services.},

abstract = {The inertia of today's power system decreases as more and more converter connected generation units and load are integrated in the power system. This results in a power system which behaves differently from before which causes concerns for many grid operators. Therefore, a detailed study is needed to investigate the relevance of this inertia in the operation, control and stability of the system. Moreover, a new definition of the term system inertia is necessary since is it expected that in the future also the renewable electricity generation units will deliver the so-called virtual (synthetic) inertia. In this paper a review of the research related to inertia in a power system is given. Both the challenges as the solutions from an operator point of view to control a system with low inertia are discussed. Also a new definition of inertia is proposed to incorporate the different forms of inertia which are each described in more detail. From recent studies, it can be concluded that the influence of reduced inertia on frequency stability is generally considered as the main challenge for system operators, but with the additional measures listed in this paper, this impact can be mitigated.},

The comparison is based on cost and annual energy yield for a given wind climate. The doubly-fed induction generator with single-stage gearbox seems the most attractive in terms of energy yield divided by cost. The doubly-fed induction generator with three-stage gearbox is a cheap solution using standard components. The permanent-magnet direct-drive generator has the highest energy yield, but although it is cheaper than the electrically-excited direct-drive generator, it is more expensive than the generator systems with gearbox},

abstract = {This thesis presents an investigation of how a direct-driven wind turbine generator should be designed and how small and efficient such a generator will be. Advantages and disadvantages of various types of direct-driven wind turbine generators are discussed, and a radial-flux permanent-magnet generator connected to a forced-commutated rectifier is chosen for a detailed theoretical investigation. Further, a design method is developed for the electromagnetic part of the chosen generator type. The generator is optimized with a simplified cost function which, besides including the cost of the active generator parts and the cost of the structure, also includes the cost of the average losses. Therefore, a method to calculate the average losses is derived. The design method is used to investigate the optimization of a 500 kW generator, and the size, efficiency and active weight of optimized generators from 30 kW to 3 MW are presented. A result of the investigation is that the outer diameters of the direct-driven generators are only slightly larger than the width of conventional wind energy converter nacelles. A comparison of average efficiency shows that direct-driven generators, including the losses in the frequency converters, are more efficient than conventional wind energy converter drive trains. Compared with other direct-driven generators, the proposed generator type is small, mainly because of the forced- commutated rectifier and because the generator is not required to produce a pull-out torque higher than the rated torque.},

It is shown that by appropriate choice of the angular width of the magnet relative to the tooth-plus-slot dimension, the cogging torque can be reduced to about 1{\%} of rated torque. A further reduction to about 0.3{\%} resulted from a rotational shift of one pair of poles with respect to the other pair in a four-pole motor.

The PCM energy conservation equation is written in terms of enthalpy. All three parabolic differential equations are numerically solved according to a finite difference approach implemented in MATLAB language. The simulations are conducted in order to derive the temperature profiles inside the PCM and to estimate the time needed to complete the melting of the PCM. Different simulation campaigns are conducted varying the inlet temperature of the heat transfer fluid.

abstract = {—Condition monitoring of induction motors is impor-tant for their efficient and reliable operation. Most of the existing electrical techniques of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are based on current, voltage, vibration, or/and flux measurements external to the motor. This paper proposes an online fault diagnos-tic system, which is based on measurements of internal main air gap flux density of an induction motor by an array of Hall effect flux sensors. Such an instrumentation is justified for large specialized induction motors with particularly high-reliability requirements. Fundamental theory behind the air gap flux density as a function of time and space, and its distortions introduced by various faults, is reviewed in this paper. Based on this theory, this paper pro-poses a comprehensive condition monitoring approach to diagnose induction motor faults including stator turn-to-turn shorts, rotor bar damage, and static and dynamic eccentricity, which may be present individually or at the same time. Moreover, the proposed approach not only detects each fault at its early stage but also de-termines its exact location and severity. The principles proposed in this paper are illustrated by extensive simulations and are ex-perimentally validated on a prototype online condition monitoring system based on National Instruments real-time platform.

Evidence suggests VSEC is also the primary mechanism responsible for the contact voltage drop. VSEC effects are seen in both elec- tromagnetic launcher (EML) efficiency and breech voltage.We compare theoretical predictions of system efficiency and breech voltage to experimental measurements for both a conventional and an augmented railgun. The characterization of VSEC extends our previous theoretical work in this area and provides new insights into the physics of EML operation, especially with regards to the armature and sliding contact. VSEC is a significant energy loss mechanism and heat source, possibly contributing to contact erosion and transition.

abstract = {We have been developing a plasma armature railgun with two distributed power supplies as the first step to produce a railgun with multiple distributed power supplies, which is considered as a promising tool for hypervelocities. The railgun has almost the same system and operational principle as those of the two-stage plasma armature railgun, which had been developed in our laboratory, except that the two power supplies are distributed along segmented rails or continuous rails. To date, we have performed 11 shots to study the railgun. For the operation of the railgun with two distributed power supplies, to control the generation of a compact plasma armature in the 2{\textless}sup{\textgreater}nd{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} railgun bore is the most important. In 8 shots the compact structure of the plasma armature was not generated due to a large amount of leakage of the plasma armature around the joint between the two railguns. However in the remaining 3 shots, the deformation of the railgun bore around the railgun joint, which is considered to be the main reason for the leakage of the plasma armature, was able to be suppressed. As a result, the compact structure of the plasma armature in the 2{\textless}sup{\textgreater}nd{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} railgun bore was generated. Based on the experimental results, we are now planning to perform the next-step experiment with a higher power supply energy.},

abstract = {The influence of selected control strategies on the level of low-order current harmonic distortion generated by an inverter connected to a distorted grid is investigated through a combination of theoretical and experimental studies. A detailed theoretical analysis, based on the concept of harmonic impedance, establishes the suitability of inductor current feedback versus output current feedback with respect to inverter power quality. Experimental results, obtained from a purpose-built 500-W, three-level, half-bridge inverter with an L-C-L output filter, verify the efficacy of inductor current as the feedback variable, yielding an output current total harmonic distortion (THD) some 29{\%} lower than that achieved using output current feedback. A feed-forward grid voltage disturbance rejection scheme is proposed as a means to further reduce the level of low-order current harmonic distortion. Results obtained from an inverter with inductor current feedback and optimized feed-forward disturbance rejection show a THD of just 3{\%} at full-load, representing an improvement of some 53{\%} on the same inverter with output current feedback and no feed-forward compensation. Significant improvements in THD were also achieved across the entire load range. It is concluded that the use of inductor current feedback and feed-forward voltage disturbance rejection represent cost-effect mechanisms for achieving improved output current quality.},

New more complex inverter topologies and new application fields come along with additional control challenges, such as: voltage imbalances, power quality issues, higher efficiency needs and fault tolerant operation, which necessarily requires the parallel development of modulation schemes. Therefore, recently there have been significant advances in the field of modulation of dc/ac converters, which conceptually has been dominated during the last several decades almost exclusively by classic pulse width modulation methods.

The physical principle of VSE is Skin Effect of pulsed current in rails, and Clustering Near Small Source and Clustering Along Short Path of steady current in armature. The corresponding methods to restrain VSE was deduced and classified in this paper as the followings: 1) to lengthen the contact surface according to the velocity skin depth expression, 2) to add a hard and resistive cladding on the rail's sliding surface and 3) to narrow the interface considering the Clustering Near Small Source, 4) to adopt U-shaped armature instead of cuboid armature and 5) to control the armature legs' thickness distribution owing to Clustering Along Short Path. The equivalent 3-D models for VSE were adopted and the contrastive simulations were carried out for three kinds of armature's legs. The most uniformed distribution of current in three interfaces was accomplished, with which the typical uniform index is about 66{\%}. The conclusion reached was that the general use of five methods and reasonable design could effectively restrain velocity skin effect.},

Firstly, the integrated analytical design tool that couples electromagnetic, structural and thermal aspects of the generator has been introduced. Then, an optimization tool based on genetic algorithm has been used to maximize the annual electricity generation and to minimize the initial cost of the generator.

abstract = {This paper proposes a design method for stepped skewing of rotor magnets to selectively eliminate the harmonics of the no-load electromotive force (EMF) and the ripple torque, which is generated by the interaction of the stator cur-rent magnetomotive force with the rotor magnet flux distribution. The method is based on the theory that a harmonic component of the ripple torque is generated by the corresponding two harmonics of the no-load EMF. An elementary unit of the proposed skewing for canceling out one harmonic EMF consists of two identical magnet blocks skewed axially. For suppressing a harmonic ripple torque, the corresponding two harmonic EMFs are canceled out by skewing two identical elementary units or a four-step skewing. In the paper, the skew angle for canceling out each harmonic EMF is theoretically obtained. It is shown that one harmonic ripple torque is almost completely suppressed by the proposed four-step skewing through two-dimensional and three-dimensional finite element method (FEM) analyses. In addition, experiments are performed to confirm the selective elimination of one harmonic EMF and to validate the FEM analyses. By using the proposed method, a multiple-step skewing can be designed to simultaneously suppress more than one harmonic component of the ripple torque.},

abstract = {The paper presents an optimized design of a low mass brushless DC (BLDC) permanent magnet motor for propulsion of an ultra light aircraft. The optimization has been carried out using Differential Evolution algorithm implemented in Matlab combined with SPEED and MotorCAD software packages for electromagnetic and thermal modeling of the BLDC motor using ActiveX technology. The credibility of the models created with SPEED and MotorCAD has been confirmed by comparing the results of simulation and measurement performed on a 12 kW synchronous permanent magnet motor available in the laboratory. The goal of the optimization has been to minimize the weight of the motor under condition that the motor delivers rated power of 15 kW at rated speed of 3000 rpm with hot-spot temperature not exceeding the temperature limits of class F insulation (155 ◦ C). Two optimal BLDC motor designs with slot/pole combinations 12/10 and 18/16 have been obtained. The motor with 18 slots and 16 poles yields the highest torque density with the lowest mass of active parts (copper+laminations+magnets) of only 5.1 kg.},

@book{Libert2004,
abstract = {Induction motors are commonly coupled to a gearbox when an application requires a low speed and a high torque. The gearbox is costly, needs maintenance and decreases the efficiency of the drive. Therefore, taking away the gearbox is very advantageous. This can be made possible by using a permanent magnet (PM) synchronous motor running directly at low speed, so called direct-drive PM synchronous motor. In this thesis, low-speed direct-drive PM motors are investigated for a 4.4 kW, 50 rpm mixer used for wastewater treatment. The thesis begins with an overview of different existing low-speed direct-driven applications. It concentrates then on a few topologies that are promising for the considered application: five different radial-flux PM machine configurations with surface-mounted or buried permanent magnets and two Torus axial-flux PM machine configurations. The designs of the PM machines are conducted by solving an optimization problem. The goal is to minimize the active weight of the machine, while fulfilling the requirements on the outer dimensions, the efficiency and the cost. The design process, based on analytical calculations as well as finite-element simulations, is described taking the particularities of each topology into account. Designs of low-speed radial-flux PM machines with high pole numbers are first calculated with conventional distributed windings and one slot per pole per phase. The results obtained for different PM machine configurations are compared. To improve further the designs, concentrated windings are investigated for PM machines with high pole numbers. Concentrated winding layouts offering high winding factors and limiting the rotor losses as well as the noise and vibrations of the machine are identified and sorted out. Some interesting concentrated winding layouts are combined with the different radial-flux PM machine configurations and further investigated with FEM simulations. The design of axial-flux PM motors is treated separately in the thesis. It was found that the Torus axial-flux PM machines are not satisfying the requirements of the application. Therefore multi-disk axial-flux PM machines are investigated. Finally, the investigated theoretical designs suitable for the application are compared and their advantages and drawbacks are emphasized.},

abstract = {The present paper suggests a procedure for identification of suitable models for the heat dynamics of a building. Such a procedure for model identification is essential for better usage of readings from smart meters, which is expected to be installed in almost all buildings in the coming years. The models can be used for different purposes, e.g. control of the indoor climate, forecasting of energy consumption, and for accurate description of energy performance of the building. Grey-box models based on prior physical knowledge and data-driven modelling are applied. This facilitates insight into otherwise hidden information about the physical properties of the building. A hierarchy of models of increasing complexity is formulated based on prior physical knowledge and a forward selection strategy is suggested enabling the modeller to iteratively select suitable models of increasing complexity. The performance of the models is compared using likelihood ratio tests, and they are validated using a combination of appropriate statistics and physical interpretation of the results. A case study is described in which a suitable model is sought after for a single storey 120 m
                        2 building. The result is a set of different models of increasing complexity, with which building characteristics, such as: thermal conductivity, heat capacity of different parts, and window area, are estimated. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {—We present an FPGA-based design approach that will allow motor control and on-board condition monitoring to be achieved in parallel using the same set of physical variables. The key idea lies in exploiting the parallelism of FPGAs to achieve the joint objectives of control and monitoring using common physical variables, namely motor phase currents. For illustration, a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) governed by Field Oriented Control (FOC) and health monitoring using Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) is considered. Since FOC is computationally intensive, the control algorithm is optimized for speed using distributed pipelining and an FFT-core is utilized for MCSA. The design stage uses MATLAB/Simulink for the reference control coupled with HDL coder for VHDL generation. The synthesis and timing analysis are done with Altera's Quartus II. The tool-chain allows easy analysis and optimization of model-based motor control algorithms. The results show that the joint objectives can be obtained with decreased current and torque ripple at the expense of modest increases in resource utilization.

After discussing some important requirements and basic relations, it describes the currently used systems: the constant speed system with squirrel-cage induction generator, and the three variable speed systems with doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), with gearbox and fully rated converter, and direct drive (DD). Then, possible future generator systems are reviewed. Hydraulic transmissions are significantly lighter than gearboxes and enable continuously variable transmission, but their efficiency is lower. A brushless DFIG is a medium speed generator without brushes and with improved low-voltage ride-through characteristics compared with the DFIG. Magnetic pseudo DDs are smaller and lighter than DD generators, but need a sufficiently low and stable magnet price to be successful. In addition, superconducting generators can be smaller and lighter than normal DD generators, but both cost and reliability need experimental demonstration. In power electronics, there is a trend toward reliable modular multilevel topologies.},

This project began at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the Fall of 1995, and later expanded through collaborations with the Georgia Institute of Technology, the Clark Atlanta University, and the University of Maryland at College Park.  The overall objective of the Micro Engine Project was to develop a small but power-dense gas turbine generator based on MEMS fabrication technologies. Thus, the project sought to develop a fuel-burning jet engine that would drive an electric generator to produce electric power for general purpose use.  Along the way, the project would advance the science and engineering of many disciplines from the MEMS perspective.  The Micro Engine Project was by its very nature a highly mult-disciplinary project pursuing advances in materials, structures, fabrication, combustion, heat transfer, turbomachinery, bearings and electromechanics, all at the MEMS scale.  Many of these topics are addressed in this volume, including:    materials structures and packaging multi-wafer MEMS fabrication and and bonding technologiesElectroplating magnetic components electroplating magnetic structures into silicon very-high-speed air bearings thermofluids and turbomachinery electric and magnetic generators combustion    About The MEMs Reference Shelf:  'The MEMs Reference Shelf is a series devoted to Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMs) which combine mechanical, electrical, optical, or fluidic elements on a common microfabricated substrate to create sensors, actuators, and microsystems.

The MPDTC scheme is designed to keep the motor torque and stator flux and the inverter's neutral point potential within given hysteresis bounds while reducing the average switching frequency of the inverter, in comparison with the standard direct torque control (DTC) method. The algorithm is embedded in the control software environment of ABB's ACS6000 medium-voltage drive, and experimental results are provided which verify the advantageous features of MPDTC in terms of average inverter switching frequency reduction. More specifically, compared to standard DTC, the proposed MPDTC scheme achieves an average (over the whole operating range) reduction of the inverter switching frequency of 16.5{\%}, but for specific operating conditions the reduction is as much as 37.4{\%}.},

abstract = {High penetration of wind generation causes concerns regarding the frequency stability if wind plants do not provide inertial response. Extensive research has been conducted to investigate the design of controller to facilitate wind plants to provide synthetic inertia. However, the economic value of synthetic inertia provision from wind plants has not yet been understood. This paper develops a methodology to incorporate the synthetic inertia provided by wind plants into power system scheduling, therefore enables to assess its economic value. Sensitivity studies are carried to analyses the impact of inertia constant, percentage of total wind plants to be equipped with synthetic inertia capability, RoCoF limit and delivery time of frequency response on the value of synthetic inertia.},

abstract = {For a grid-connected converter with an LCL filter, the harmonic compensators of a proportional-resonant (PR) controller are usually limited to several low-order current harmonics due to system instability when the compensated frequency is out of the bandwidth of the system control loop. In this paper, a new current feedback method for PR current control is proposed. The weighted average value of the currents flowing through the two inductors of the LCL filter is used as the feedback to the current PR regulator. Consequently, the control system with the LCL filter is degraded from a third-order function to a first-order one. A large proportional control-loop gain can be chosen to obtain a wide control-loop bandwidth, and the system can be optimized easily for minimum current harmonic distortions, as well as system stability. The inverter system with the proposed controller is investigated and compared with those using traditional control methods. Experimental results on a 5-kW fuel-cell inverter are provided, and the new current control strategy has been verified.},

abstract = {—Accurate and continuous rotor position information is essential for switched reluctance motor (SRM) drives operating in variable speed drive applications. To increase the SRM drives re-liability regarding position sensor failures, an active position sensor fault-tolerant controller is presented in this paper. The proposed approach uses two sensorless methods and a position sensor with a maximum-likelihood voting algorithm. The rotor position is esti-mated from the sensorless method in case of position sensor fault, by an improved pulse injection method in the current-chopping-control mode in a low-speed operation and a current-gradient method in the single-pulse-control mode in a high-speed opera-tion. Through the analysis of the fault position signals of SRM, a new fault diagnosis method of position signals based on the predic-tions of the edges is adopted in this paper. Experimental results on a three-phase 12/8 SRM demonstrate the effectiveness of both the fault diagnosis algorithm and the fault-tolerant control scheme.

The sensor mainly consists of a magnetic concentration ring, a newly designed RGP, an image converter, and an image acquisition and processing system. The grating-polarizer is employed to convert the polarization plane's rotation of a linearly polarized light into the rotation of a circular facula, which then be converted into the horizontal linear movement of a linear facula by an image converter. Thus, a Faraday rotation angle can be measured directly by positioning the dark stripe in the facula. A 110-kV prototype with the rated current 300 A is completed, and trail run on the line.

abstract = {Compared with the state-of-the-art Si-based power devices, enhancement-mode Gallium Nitride (E-mode GaN) transistors have better figures of merit and exhibit great potential in enabling higher switching frequency, higher efficiency, and higher power density for power converters. The bridge-leg configuration circuit, consisting of a controlling switch and a synchronous switch, is a critical component in many power converters. However, owing to the low threshold voltage and fast switching speed, E-mode GaN devices are more prone to false turn-on phenomenon in bridge-leg configuration, leading to undesirable results, such as higher switching loss, circuit oscillation, and shoot through. In order to expand gate terminal's safe operating margin without increasing reverse conduction loss during deadtime, negative gate voltage bias for turn-off and antiparallel diode could be applied to E-mode GaN device. In this paper, with consideration of strong nonlinearities in C-V and I-V characteristics of high-voltage (650 V) E-mode GaN transistors, analytical device models are first developed. Then, we develop an analytical circuit model that combines the circuit parameters with intrinsic characteristics of the high-voltage GaN transistor and antiparallel diode. Thus, key transient waveforms with regard to the false turn-on problem can be acquired, including displacement current and false triggering voltage pulse on gate terminal. The simulated waveforms are then verified on a testing board with GaN-based bridge-leg circuit. In contrast to piece-wise switching process models and PSpice simulation, the proposed model exhibits outstanding performances. To provide design guidelines for mitigating false turn-on of GaN transistor, the impacts of different circuit parameters, along with the optimum negative gate voltage bias, are investigated based on the proposed model.},

This paper presents a comprehensive performance comparison of an external rotor surface-mounted PM synchronous generator equipped with three commonly used winding types, i.e., integral-slot distributed winding (ISDW), fractional-slot concentrated winding (FSCW), and fractional-slot distributed winding. The tradeoff between torque and the power factor, loss distribution, current, torque, and PM demagnetization characteristics under a short-circuit fault and the steady temperature rise are investigated and compared using finite-element analyses. It is found that, generally, FSCW PM generators exhibit high rotor losses compared with ISDWs, which will lead to an overly high temperature rise. Measures such as segment PMs and the adoption of lamination steel in the rotor can reduce the rotor loss and greatly improve the machine efficiency. However, the temperature rise of FSCW machines is still higher than that of ISDW machines. The conclusion is intended to help choose the proper winding types.},

It will be shown that a grid-connected inverter will remain stable if the ratio between the grid impedance and the inverter output impedance satisfies the Nyquist stability criterion. This new impedance-based stability criterion is a generalization to the existing stability criterion for voltage-source systems, and can be applied to all current-source systems.

abstract = {Wind power is still the most promising renewable energy in the year of 2013. The wind turbine system (WTS) started with a few tens of kilowatt power in the 1980s. Now, multimegawatt wind turbines are widely installed even up to 6–8 MW. There is a widespread use of wind turbines in the distribution networks and more and more wind power stations, acting as power plants, are connected directly to the transmission networks. As the grid penetration and power level of the wind turbines increase steadily, the wind power starts to have significant impacts to the power grid system. Therefore, more advanced generators, power electronic systems, and control solutions have to be introduced to improve the characteristics of the wind power plant and make it more suitable to be integrated into the power grid. Meanwhile, there are also some emerging technology challenges, which need to be further clarified and investigated. This paper gives an overview and discusses some development trends in the technologies used for wind power systems. First, the developments of technology and market are generally discussed. Next, several state-of-the-art wind turbine concepts, as well as the corresponding power electronic converters and control structures, are reviewed, respectively. Furthermore, grid requirements and the technology challenges for the future WTS are also addressed.},

abstract = {This thesis presents design, optimization, construction and test of radial-flux low-speed rare-earth high-energy permanent-magnet (PM) electrical machines with new topology. Two of the designed machines can be used as directly driven wind energy generators. Due to absence of the field current and field winding, permanent magnet generators exhibit high efficiency in operation, simple and robust structure in construction and high power to weight ratio. The attractiveness of the permanent magnet generators is further enhanced by the availability of high-energy permanent magnet materials like NdFeB. Based on the equivalent magnetic circuit approach and permanent magnet load line characteristics, iterative preliminary design for the proposed generator was firstly carried out. The aim of this simple linear pre-design tool was to have an initial geometry for the detailed investigations of the finite element technique (FET) where the electromagnetic behavior of the machine was optimized. The stator of the machine was slotted. Slotted configuration was chosen as it permits lower effective air gap length and therefore thin magnets can be used. This, in fact, largely decreases the cost of active material as it is dominated by that of the magnets. However, cogging torque comes as a consequence of slots. The cogging torque of the machine was estimated using the flux-MMF technique enhanced by the FET. Cogging torque is an oscillatory torque caused by the variation of the co-energy of the permanent magnets with respect to the rotor position, resulting from the variation of the magnetic circuit seen by the magnets. It is an inherent characteristic of slotted permanent magnet machines. It should be studied and minimized in the applications where minimizing torque ripple, vibration and noise are essential requirements. The configuration of the rotor corresponding to the lowest cogging torque was adopted. The prototype machine was constructed using novel updated high-energy permanent magnets with a remanent of 1.41T. The stator laminations of the machine were cut using laser technology methods. The slots of the machine were flat and the windings were of toroidal type (torus) with short ends. This, in turn, reduced the cost and weight of active material and improved the efficiency. The permanent magnets were rectangular blocks of NdFeB with flux concentration arrangement and magnetized tangentially on the rotor support structure. Soft magnetic material is attached to both poles of the permanent magnets, which not only produced an easy path for the flux penetration but also reduced the leakage flux and therefore a typical ‘rule of thumb' value for the leakage flux coefficient was achieved. The rotor support structure of the machine was manufactured from nonmagnetic light material (Aluminum). To further reduce the total weight of the machine, longitudinal holes were excavated inside the rotor support structure. The constructed prototype machine was tested as variable low-speed generator with different loading conditions. Good agreement between the theoretically predicted and experimentally obtained results has been achieved. The inertia of the system together with the cogging torque necessitated a peak starting torque of 64{\%} of the rated torque. To reduce this starting torque, the slot openings were filled up with bonded soft magnetic material with a relative permeability equals 10. The peak value of the starting torque has been reduced to 43{\%} of the rated torque. The cogging torque of the machine was estimated again and the performance of the slot-filled machine was studied and compared with the previous case. The manufactured prototype machine was single phase. Three-phase is also possible. The number of phases is usually determined based on the type of the load and the rated power demand. Finite element analysis and theoretical study were carried out on two three-phase machines of the same topology. The first one is a four-pole three-slot machine and the second one is ten-pole six-slot design.},

The motor and the generator are at the heart of the vehicle drive and energy system and often utilize expensive rare-earth permanent magnet (PM) material. This paper reviews and addresses the research work that has been carried out to reduce the amount of rare-earth material that is used while maintaining the high efficiency and performance that rare-earth PM machines offer. These new machines can use either less rare-earth PM material, weaker ferrite magnets, or no magnets; and they need to meet the high performance that the more usual interior PM synchronous motor with sintered neodymium-iron-boron magnets provides. These machines can take the form of PM-assisted synchronous reluctance machines, induction machines, switched reluctance machines, wound rotor synchronous machines (claw pole or biaxially excited), double-saliency machines with ac or dc stator current control, or brushless dc multiple-phase reluctance machines.},

Consequently, a reduction in IMMD size is achieved by eliminating inverter heat sink and optimizing the choice of DC-link capacitors. Gate signals of the IMMD segments are shifted (interleaved) to cancel the capacitor voltage ripple and further reduce the capacitor size. Motor winding configuration and coupling effect are also investigated to match with the IMMD design. An actively controlled balancing resistor is programmed to balance the voltages of series connected IMMD segments.

The currents contain high-frequency (HF) components which are in-versely proportional to machine inductance.

A bandpass filter is designed to extract the selected sideband components, and their root-mean-square (rms) values are measured. The rms values in all phases are compared. It is shown that the rms ripple current ratios be-tween two adjacent phases provide a very good means of detecting turn fault with high signal-to-noise ratio. The detection method can identify the faulted phase and tolerate inherent imbalance of the machine, and is hardly affected by transient states. The method is assessed by simulations and experiments on a five-phase PM machine.

Depending on the installed DER, the cost minimizing solution for supplying reactive power locally is chosen. Costs include the variable cost of the additional losses and the investment cost of appropriately over-sizing converters or purchasing capacitors.

The use of wideband III-nitride (such as GaN) devices today is limited to telecom and low-power applications. The current lack of high-frequency high-power drivers prevents their application in power converters. The proposed circuit is based upon resonant switching transition techniques, by means of an LC tag, to recover part of the power back into the voltage source in order to reduce the power loss. This circuit also uses level shifters to generate the zero and negative gate-source voltages required to turn the GaN HFET on and off, and it is highly tolerant to input-signal timing variances. The circuit reduces the overall power consumed in the driver and thus reduces the power loss. This is particularly important for high-frequency driver operation to take full advantage, in terms of efficiency, of the superior switching speed of GaN devices. In this paper, the topology of the low-power-loss high-speed drive circuit is introduced. Some simulation results and preliminary experimental measurements are discussed.},

abstract = {Smart grids are often analyzed using a top-down approach, i.e., starting from communication and control technologies evolution, to then focus on their effects on active and passive users, in terms of new services, higher efficiency and quality of supply. However, with their bottom-up approach, virtual power plants (VPP) are very promising instruments for promoting an effective integration of distributed generation (DG) and energy storage devices as well as valid means for enabling consumers to respond to load management signals, when operated under the supervision of a scheduling coordinator. These aggregation factors can be very profitable for the distributed energy resources (DERs) economy and for the energy network itself. This paper presents a new algorithm to optimize the day-ahead thermal and electrical scheduling of a large scale VPP (LSVPP) which contains: a) many small-scale producers and consumers (“prosumers”) distributed over a large territory and b) energy storage and cogeneration processes. The algorithm also takes into account the actual location of each DER in the public network and their specific capability. Thermal and electrical generator models, load and storage devices are very detailed and flexible, as are the rates and incentives framework. Several novelties, with respect to the previous literature, are proposed. Case study results are also described and discussed},

With this technique, PM motors can change negative salient poles into positive salient poles by applying the magnetization of the PM. Furthermore, we discuss the combi-nation of reversible salient poles with variable magnetic force to increase the efficiency of the motor under partial load. This paper proposes a novel PM motor that uses our proposed technique to reverse saliency and describes the principle of reversible pole saliency as well as the resulting motor characteristics. When the proposed motor operates with a negative salient pole, a higher torque is produced at low speeds; when the motor reverses to a positive salient pole, higher power and efficiency are produced at high speeds. These results confirm that the proposed motor can reverse the saliency direction of the pole and that this reversibility allows the motor to achieve high torque at low speeds and high power at high speeds. Consequently, the motor can operate over a wide range of speeds.},

abstract = {Large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable energy (namely wind energy and solar PV) may entail new challenges in power systems and more volatility in power prices in liberalized electricity markets. Energy storage can diminish this imbalance, relieving the grid congestion, and promoting distributed generation. The economic implications of grid-scale electrical energy storage technologies are however obscure for the experts, power grid operators, regulators, and power producers. A meticulous technoeconomic or cost-benefit analysis of electricity storage systems requires consistent, updated cost data and a holistic cost analysis framework. To this end, this study critically examines the existing literature in the analysis of life cycle costs of utility-scale electricity storage systems, providing an updated database for the cost elements (capital costs, operational and maintenance costs, and replacement costs). Moreover, life cycle costs and levelized cost of electricity delivered by electrical energy storage is analyzed, employing Monte Carlo method to consider uncertainties. The examined energy storage technologies include pumped hydropower storage, compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheel, electrochemical batteries (e.g. lead-acid, NaS, Li-ion, and Ni-Cd), flow batteries (e.g. vanadium-redox), superconducting magnetic energy storage, supercapacitors, and hydrogen energy storage (power to gas technologies). The results illustrate the economy of different storage systems for three main applications: bulk energy storage, T{\&}D support services, and frequency regulation.},

abstract = {An electrical conduction model for silver filled isotropically conductive adhesives (ICA) was developed. The model combines the microscopic resistance of the bulk silver particles and the contact between silver flakes with the macroscale resistor network calculation by percolation theory. The resistivities of the composites were calculated by resistor network simulations considering both contact effects and particle size effects. Three different types of film typically exist on the silver surface: residual organic films; tarnish films; and a thin epoxy layer. The contact resistance between silver flakes can be due to a constriction resistance, to the tunneling resistance through insulating films, or to the resistance of more conductive layers. The constriction resistance is produced by the restriction of the current flow by small contact spots and is controlled by the actual contact spot area (metallic contact), which is dependent on the contact force between flakes. The tunneling resistance is caused by the very thin layer which may reside on the silver flakes between the metallic contact spots, and is dependent on a barrier film thickness and potential. Oxide and sulfide tarnish films are typically degenerate semiconductors. Two- and three-dimensional (2-D and 3-D) computer simulations were performed to predict the effects of particle sizes, shapes, and distribution on the percolation conduction thresholds and cluster sizes. The model predicts that the percolation threshold decreases with broad particle size distributions and high aspect ratio particles. The effective resistivity of the adhesive depends on the thickness dimension of the adhesive pad geometry, with very thin layers resulting in high percolation thresholds and high resistivities. Resistivity does not change with the pad thicknesses greater than a certain thickness level. Silver flake orientation on the surface increases the resistivity of the conductive adhesive pads, but in the same magnitude range. The resistivities of the materials are controlled by silver flake sizes and the nature of the contacts},

The approach is discussed in the perspective of effectiveness and ade- quacy. Its consequences toDNOcontrol effort are evaluated.

abstract = {Increasing power system flexibility by responsive demand is a central issue for the incorporation of higher levels of variable wind generation in future power systems. The electrification of the heat sector, except from energy efficiency gains, may offer a vast potential of new forms of flexible demand, by time-shifting of heat production in buildings. The assessment of this potential can, however, be performed only when the limitations imposed by the primary operation of the equipment (space heating) are realistically taken into account. In this paper, a methodology is presented for the quantification of the flexibility offered by the thermal storage of building stock equipped with heat pumps, to power systems with significant penetration of wind power. A model is proposed for the incorporation of the building stock thermal behavior as equivalent energy storage in electricity market models. At the same time, the model allows the coupling to a detailed dynamic thermal model of buildings for the assessment of the respective operational restrictions. The case study presents the results of a project for the evaluation of the flexibility offered by portfolios of high heat pump deployment in conjunction with high wind penetration scenarios for the future German electricity system.},

abstract = {In order to improve the efficiency of wind power generation system (WPGS), many researchers have tried to develop a larger WPGS and a superconducting synchronous generator (SCSG) has been suggested to develop over 5 MW class WPGS. There are two expected types of drive-train, geared and gearless. The structure and electrical parameters of the SCSG depend on the type of drive-train used. This paper deals with a comparative analysis of the 10 MW class geared and gearless types of the SCSG for WPGS. Three drive-trains are designed for the 10 MW class SCSGs using the finite elements method analysis tool. The PSCAD/EMTDC is utilized to simulate electrical and dynamic behaviors of the modeled SCSGs. The simulation results show the operation characteristics of the designed SCSGs and suggest that the single-stage gearbox type drive-train is the most efficient drive-train for the SCSG due to the reduction of the number of rotor poles and the volume of the generator, even though the geared-type drive-train requires periodical maintenance. {\textcopyright} 2002-2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {This article presents the outcomes of a recent study carried out among wind energy manufacturers and developers regarding the current generation costs of wind energy projects in Europe, the factors that most influence them, as well as the reasons behind their recent increase and their expected future evolution. The research finds that the generation costs of an onshore wind farm are between 4.5 and 8.7 ???cent/kWh; 6-11.1 ???cent/kWh when located offshore, with the number of full hours and the level of capital cost being the most influencing elements. Generation costs have increased by more than 20{\%} over the last 3 years mainly due to a rise of the price of certain strategic raw materials at a time when the global demand has boomed. However, the competitive position of wind energy investments vis-??-vis other technologies has not been altered. In the long-term, one would expect production costs go down; whether this will be enough to offset the higher price of inputs will largely depend on the application of correct policies, like R{\&}D in new materials, O{\&}M with remote-control devices, offshore wind turbines and substructures; introduction of advanced siting and forecasting techniques; access to adequate funding; and long-term legal stability. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Antler1981,
abstract = { The wear of metallic contacts occurs by adhesion, abrasion, brittle fracture, fretting, and delamination processes. Adhesive wear can be in mild or severe regimes and is promoted by surface cleanliness and contact pressure. The severe adhesive wear mechanism in early sliding ofAu, Pd, Ag, Sn, SnPb alloys, and many other metals is prow formation, characterized by the transfer of metal from the member with the larger surface involved in sliding to the smaller. On repeat-pass movement a transition to rider wear occurs in which the direction of metal transfer reverses. Prow formation occurs readilywith ductile metals because it requires a large growth of mating asperities. Neither the hardness nor the presence of codeposited polymer in pure or alloy gold e!ectrodeposits is as significant as their ductility in determining performance. Codeposited polymer is not a lubricant, but it may inhibit plastic flow of the metal, reducing ductility and thereby indirectly minimizing the tendency to adhesive wear. Golds that contain a few tenths of a percent of cobalt or nickel from dc-plated acid cyanide baths have good adhesive wear resistance. Abrasive wear of a metal occurs when it is slid against a rough hard surface. Ductile metals resist fracture during abrasion; both high hardness and ductility are desirable. Wrought metals, such as inlays, are generally more durable than the cobalt and nickel dc gold electrodeposits in abrasive wear. Fretting, or oscillatory sliding through a small amplitude, leads quickly to high contact resistance with base metals, because oxide debris accumulates between the members. Fretting may also degrade the contact resistance of mated connectors if gold finishes on their contacts wear through, thereby exposing the base substrate. Delamination wear, which appears first as a substrate, then as surface cracks, followed by the loosening of surface material, contributes to contact failure in fretting. Hard substrates and underplates are desirable because they reduce adhesive, abrasive, and fretting wear. Smooth surfaces are superior to rough surfaces when adhesive and abrasive wear can occur.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel methodology for comparing thermal energy storage to electrochemical, chemical, and mechanical energy storage technologies. The underlying physics of this model is hinged on the development of a round trip efficiency formulation for these systems. The charging and discharging processes of compressed air energy storage, flywheel energy storage, fuel cells, and batteries are well understood and defined from a physics standpoint in the context of comparing these systems. However, the challenge lays in comparing the charging process of these systems with the charging process of thermal energy storage systems for concentrating solar power plants (CSP). The round trip efficiency and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) are the metrics used for comparison purposes. The thermal energy storage system is specifically compared to vanadium redox, sodium sulphur, and compressed air energy storage (CAES) systems from a large scale storage perspective of 100's of MWh. The rationale behind this analysis was to develop an electrical storage efficiency for molten salt thermal energy storage systems, such that it can be compared to battery energy storage technologies in the context of comparing CSP with thermal energy storage to solar photovoltaic with battery storage from a utility scale perspective. The results from the modelling using Andasol 3 CSP plant as a case study yield a storage efficiency of 86{\%} and LCOE of {\$}216/MWh. The results of this modelling will facilitate the future generation of a thermal energy storage roadmap.},

abstract = {The flux-switching permanent-magnet (FSPM) motor has been viewed as a highly reliable machine with both armature windings and magnets on the stator. Owing to the high torque-production capability with low torque ripple, FSPM motors with a higher number of phases are potential candidates for traction applications in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). However, existing research has mostly focused on the principles and static performance of multiphase FSPM motors, and little attention has been paid to advanced control strategies. In this paper, the fully decoupled current control of a 36/34-pole nine-phase FSPM (NP-FSPM) motor is developed and the performance under different operating conditions is investigated. The aim of the design is to alleviate cross coupling effects and unwanted low-order stator harmonic currents, to guarantee fast transient response and small steady-state error. In addition, its fault-tolerance is further elaborated. These features are very important in automotive applications where low torque pulsation, high fault-tolerant capability and high dynamic performance are of major importance. Firstly, the research status of multiphase FSPM motors is briefly reviewed. Secondly, the mathematical model in the dq reference frames and control strategies are presented. Then, the control and performance of the NP-FSPM motor are evaluated by using MATLAB/Simulink. Finally, experiments on an NP-FSPM motor prototype are carried out to validate the study.},

abstract = {—This paper presents methods to enhance the quality of spatial information that can be extracted when using the motor drive as a diagnostic sensor. When using the state-of-the-art motor drive-based techniques for extracting spatial information related to the state of wear in a gear train driven by an ac machine, po-sition sensor-induced periodic position measurement errors and machine-induced spatial harmonic torque ripple can degrade the quality and the detail of the information that can be extracted. In this work, this degradation of information is displayed exper-imentally, and it is demonstrated that the quality of the spatial information extracted can be significantly improved through im-plementation of existing model reference adaptive system (MRAS)-based nonideal sensor property decoupling techniques and newly developed MRAS-based spatial harmonic torque ripple decoupling techniques. Furthermore, it is identified and demonstrated in this work that by removing the gear mesh harmonic component from the gear wear information extracted using the state-of-the-art tech-niques, and then calculating the spatial rate of change of this new information, a new signal is generated that strongly correlates to local gear tooth defects in a gear train driven by an ac machine.

abstract = {Globally, buildings are responsible for 40{\%} of the total world annual energy consumption which is responsible for one-third of green house gas emissions around the world. A significant portion of this energy is used for lighting, heating, cooling, and air conditioning purposes in buildings. Increasing awareness of the environmental impact of green house gas emissions and CFCs triggered a renewed interest in environmentally friendly cooling, and heating technologies for buildings. Free cooling of buildings may be seen as an alternate to compressor based air conditioning systems used for the buildings. In free cooling, nighttime cold is accumulated in storage material and extracted when needed. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs) can be used for free-cooling purposes due to their high storage density. In free cooling, using PCM as storage material, cool air during night is used to solidify the PCM and the accumulated cold is extracted during the hot day times. In this article a detailed review of work conducted by different researchers on PCM based free cooling is presented. Major challenges being faced in the design of PCM based free cooling system such as phase change materials; their thermo-physical properties and the geometry of encapsulation are elaborated and discussed in detail. Also the parameters effecting the charging and discharging of PCM, effect of phase change temperature and climatic conditions on thermal performance of the free cooling system are also discussed. Potential reduction in CO2 emissions due to the applicability of free cooling systems in residential and commercial buildings is also discussed in this article. This paper also provides a comprehensive list of the PCMs currently being used and that can be used potentially for free cooling applications. At last, this paper also presents some current problems needed further research in this area. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The primary goal is to reduce the switching frequency ripple at a reasonable cost, while at the same time achieving a high-performance front-end rectifier (as characterized by a rapid dynamic response and good stability margin). An example LCL filter design is reported and a filter has been built and tested using the values obtained from this design. The experimental results demonstrate the performance of the design procedure both for the LCL filter and for the rectifier controller. The system is stable and the grid current harmonic content is low both in the lowand high-frequency ranges. Moreover, the good agreement that was obtained between simulation and experimental results validates the proposed approach. Hence, the design procedure and the simulation model provide a powerful tool to design an LCL-filter-based active rectifier while avoiding trial-and-error procedures that can result in having to build several filter prototypes.},

abstract = {This thesis focuses on permanent magnet "direct drive" electrical generators for wind turbines with large power output. A variety of such generator topologies is reviewed, tested and optimised in an attempt to increase their potential as commercial concepts for the wind industry. Direct drive electrical generators offer a reliable alternative to gearbox drivetrains. This novel technology reduces energy loses thus allowing more energy to be yield from the wind and decreases the maintenance cost at the same time. A fundamental issue for these generators is their large size which makes them difficult to manufacture, transport and assembly. A number of structural designs have been suggested in the literature in an attempt to minimise this attribute. A set of design tools are set out in an attempt to investigate the structural stiffness of the different permanent magnet direct drive generator topologies against a number of structural stresses that apply to such wind turbine energy converters. Optimisation techniques, both analytical and structural, are also developed for minimising the total mass of a variety of "directly driven" machines with power output of 5MW or greater. Conventional and promising generator designs are modelled and optimised with the use of these optimisation techniques. The topologies under examination are then compared in terms of structural mass, stiffness and cost. As the number of wind turbine manufactures who adopt the direct drive concept increases, it is important to outline the unique characteristics of the different topologies and increase their manufacturing potential. Discussions and conclusions will provide an indication of the design solutions that could help decrease the mass and cost of such machines.},

This paper presents a filter-capacitor current feedback control scheme for grid-connected converter. The controller is consisted of a proportional-resonance regulator and a proportional regulator. Unlike the existing control strategy with unit capacitor current feedback, the proposed method applies the proportional regulator to the feedback path, which can decouple these two regulators, and simplify the tuning process. Controller parameters are tuned with the aid of root-locus of system close-loop transfer function, which can provide better grasp of the influence of individual parameters and make the design process visible and holistic without any simplification and assumption. The validity, reasonability and feasibility of the control strategy and the proposed current controller design method are verified by the simulation results of a 50kVA grid-connected inverter.},

In recent years, they have become more available, playing an increasingly important role in electric power grid upgrades. This requires developing accurate models for relay testing and relay performance evaluations to ensure that the system equipment is safe. This study presents several models developed for OCT: analog, digital, and complete models. It applies previously studied and presented frequency-response characteristics to develop a transfer function using a complex curve-fitting method. An analog circuit model is constructed from the developed transfer function via a network synthesis method. A digital model is presented by transforming the developed transfer function into a digital domain transfer function using bilinear transformation. The digital model implementation is performed by the direct form I block diagram. The optics model and electronics model of the device are developed separately and are then combined to present a complete model. The Jones calculus method is used for optical modeling, and a developed transfer function is used for electronics modeling. All of the developed models are verified through the frequency-response results and tested with PSpice and Matlab Simulink programs. The results show that the developed models can be used as legitimate OCT models.},

abstract = {This paper presents a robust current control scheme for inductor-capacitor-inductor (LCL)-filtered distributed generation (DG) inverters featuring effective suppression of low- and high-frequency instabilities and grid-induced distortion and disturbances. The conceptual design of the proposed control scheme is to maximize the disturbance rejection performance against grid disturbances and parametric uncertainties, and minimize the coupling among active damping, disturbance rejection, and tracking controllers. First, a simple and robust active damping controller is realized by drooping the inverter control voltage with the capacitor current. Second, the augmented damped dynamics is used to design a robust controller, which is composed of a tracking controller, dynamic grid-disturbance rejection controller, and uncertainty rejection controller. The tracking controller is designed to yield deadbeat control performance to maximize the dynamic performance of the converter. The grid-disturbance rejection controller is designed to provide a base-line of grid-induced dynamics within the closed-loop system as an internal model; therefore, effective mitigation of grid-induced distortion can be achieved without a priori knowledge of the frequency modes to be eliminated. The uncertainty rejection controller is designed to reject voltage disturbances associated with parameter variation and imperfect compensation of the grid-disturbance-rejection controller. Theoretical analysis and comparative test results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

The use of system integration may lead to an increase in loss density and local or component temperatures. For this reason much attention needs to be paid to the thermal design aspects of the system. In the aerospace industry weight and reliability are of significant importance. In this paper the integration of a permanent magnet machine and power electronics into a single structure with joint thermal management is investigated. An overall goal of 2 kW/kg is set for system power density. Additionally in this paper fault tolerance is introduced into the design. This will allow the system to continue functioning should a single electrical fault occur. Principle faults are identified and discussed. A 50 kW, 6 phase, 8 pole permanent magnet machine is presented with a rotor speed of 50 krpm. A symmetrical phase shifted full bridge is used to drive the permanent magnet machine, aiding the functionality of fault tolerance and enabling the use of soft switching. A mathematical model for both machine and power electronics is created and used to calculate phase currents and losses in the machine and power electronics. Finally, spatial integration and thermal management concepts are presented and analysed.},

abstract = {This paper develops design methodology for finding the lower bound of the passive components for AC back-to-back voltage source converters. Compared with numerous previous works focusing on energy storage passives, the proposed approach considers input EMI filters and various operating modes. The spectrum of the pulsating phase-leg voltage with discontinuous space vector modulation scheme (DPWM) is analyzed, based on which the relationship between the switching frequency and the EMI filter parameters is studied. Then the rules for selecting line inductance and DC link capacitance are derived from the consideration of the current ripple and system stability requirement. The impact of DC link ripple current and failure mode operation is also included. The experiment system is constructed and the results show the feasibility of implementing the minimum passive components.},

Currently, there is an increase of voltage and current harmonics in power systems, caused by nonlinear loads. The active power filters (APFs) are used to compensate the generated harmonics and to correct the load power factor. The proposed control design is a pulse width modulation control (PWM) with two blocks that include neural networks. Adaptive networks estimate the reference compensation currents. On the other hand, a multilayer perceptron feedforward network (trained by a backpropagation algorithm) that works as a hysteresis band comparator is used. Two practical cases with Matlab-Simulink are presented to check the proposed control performance.},

As a result, a new generation of power devices is being developed for power converter applications in which traditional Si power devices show limited operation. The use of these new power semiconductor devices will allow both an important improvement in the performance of existing power converters and the development of new power converters, accounting for an increase in the efficiency of the electric energy transformations and a more rational use of the electric energy. At present, SiC and GaN are the more promising semiconductor materials for these new power devices as a consequence of their outstanding properties, commercial availability of starting material, and maturity of their technological processes. This paper presents a review of recent progresses in the development of SiC- and GaN-based power semiconductor devices together with an overall view of the state of the art of this new device generation.},

abstract = {Distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) is one of the well-known and effective strategies adopted in distribution network. The goal of DFR problem is to obtain a new topological structure for distribution feeders by rearranging the status of switches such that an optimal configuration would be obtained. The existence of Distributed Generation (DG) can affect the entire power system and especially distribution networks. This paper presents an efficient approach for multi-objective DFR problem considering the simultaneous effect of DG units. The objective functions to be investigated are 1) power losses, 2) voltage deviation of buses, 3) emission produced by DG units and distribution companies and 4) the total cost of the active power generated by DG units and distribution companies. The new evolutionary method is based on an efficient multi-objective hybrid honey bee mating optimization (HBMO) and shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) called MHBMO-SFLA. The proposed hybrid algorithm integrates the outstanding characteristics of SFLA to improve the performance of HBMO algorithm sufficiently. In the proposed MHBMO-SFLA, an external repository is considered to save non-dominated solutions which are found during the search process. Also, since the objective functions are not the same, a fuzzy clustering technique is utilized to control the size of the repository within the limits. A distribution test feeder is considered to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} Shiraz University.},

First, different types of common WECSs are classified according to their features and drive train types. The WECSs are compared on the basis of the volume, weight, cost, efficiency, system reliability and fault ride through capability. The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control, which aims to make the generator speed meet an optimum value to ensure the maximum energy yield, plays a key role in the variable speed WECSs. A comprehensive review and comparison of the four most popular MPPT control methods are carried out and improvements for each method are presented. Furthermore, the latest development of wind energy conversion technologies is introduced, such as the brushless doubly fed induction generator (BDFIG), the stator permanent magnet synchronous generators, the magnetic-geared generators, dual power flow WECS with the electrical variable transmission (EVT) machine, and direct grid-connected WECS.

abstract = {In direct-drive electric propulsion systems, where there is no reduction gear to minimize and absorb the adverse effects of cogging torque generated by the permanent-magnet (PM) machine, minimization of cogging torque generation is of particular importance. In this paper, a novel axial pole-pairing method is proposed to minimize cogging torque generation in a special three-phase outer-rotor PM brushless machine, which uses uneven stator poles to enhance back electromotive force (EMF). Analytical formulas of the machine's cogging torque are first derived. The new technique is compared with conventional cogging torque suppression methods by means of analytical models and comprehensive finite-element analysis (FEA). The FEA results show that the new method not only achieves effective cogging torque reduction, but also results in improved harmonic content of the back EMF. The validity of the FEA model is verified by experimental results from the prototype machines. Finally, the significance of optimizing both the load-independent machine design techniques and load-dependent driving techniques to achieve overall torque ripple minimization is discussed.},

abstract = {Voltage-oriented PI control of three-phase grid-connected pulsewidth-modulation rectifiers with LCL filters is addressed. LCL filters require resonance damping. Active resonance damping is state of the art to face the problem, but it is still under investigation because of the manifold solutions. It is often realized using many sensors and/or complex control algorithms. In contrast, pure PI control requires only one set of current sensors, and its implementation and design are rather simple and well known from the L filter control. PI control has already been shown to be a suitable solution also for LCL filters, but there are limitations. These are investigated in this paper. System stability is analyzed with respect to different ratios of LCL filter resonance and control frequencies. The latter are important parameters for system design and control. Both line and converter current control are analyzed. For a certain range of frequency ratios, the voltage-oriented PI control gives stable performance without additional feedback, but for ratios outside this range, stable operation is impossible. Experimental tests validate the theoretical results. In addition, an experimentally determined LCL filter transfer function is shown in this paper, which shows a lower resonance peak as expected from commonly used filter models.},

abstract = {This paper presents optimal control of a five-phase Integrated Modular Permanent Magnet Motor for normal and open-circuit fault conditions. Finite element analysis of the motor is carried out to obtain output torque of the motor. It is found that the output torque ripple of the machine when supplied with sinusoidal currents is considerably high. An optimum control technique is presented to operate the machine with minimum torque ripple and least stator ohmic loss. Furthermore, an optimum fault tolerant control method under open-circuit fault conditions is presented. Due to the half bridge and split capacitor configuration used for this modular motor drive the neutral voltage fluctuates considerably during the fault condition. To solve this problem, a constraint to make the summation of the phase currents to zero is incorporated in the derivation of the fault tolerant optimal control strategy. Optimal currents are calculated for normal and open-circuit fault-tolerant operation of the machine. Simulation results are presented for the verification of the control methods. Although the control techniques discussed in this work are applied for the five phase modular permanent magnet machine, they can be extended for multiphase permanent magnet machines with any number of phases.},

abstract = {Data from the ITRS2003 roadmap for 2010 predicts voltages for microprocessors in hand-held electronics will decrease to 0.8V with current and power increasing to 4A and 3W, respectively. Consequently, low power converters will move to multimegahertz frequencies with a resulting reduction in capacitor and inductor values by factors of 5 and 20, respectively. Values required at 10 MHz, for a low power buck converter, are estimated at 130 nH and 0.6 uF, compatible with the integration of magnetics onto silicon and the concept of power supply-on-chip (PSOC). A review of magnetics-on-silicon shows that inductance values of 20 to 40nH/mm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} can be achieved for winding resistances less than 1{\&}Omega;. A 1-{\&}mu;H inductance can be achieved at 5 MHz with dc resistance of 1{\&}Omega; and a Q of four. Thin film magnetic materials, compatible with semiconductor processing, offer power loss density that is lower than ferrite by a factor of 5 at 10 MHz. Other data reported includes, lowest dc resistance values of 120 m{\&}Omega; for an inductance of 120 nH; highest Q of 15 for an inductance of 350 nH and a current of 1 A for a 1- {\&}mu;H inductor. Future technology challenges include reducing losses using high resistivity, laminated magnetic materials, and increasing current carrying capability using high aspect-ratio, electroplated copper conductors. Compatible technologies are available in the power switch, control, and packaging space. Integrated capacitor technology is still a long-term challenge with maximum reported values of 400 nF/cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}.},

For utility-scale PV system, the single-stage scheme is used for high efficiency and simple power converter topology. The proposed MPPT approach utilising a modified particle swarm optimisation method is interrelated with other control schemes. The MPP changes with variation in solar irradiation and temperature. Also, the PV power characteristic of large system is characterised by multiple peaks under partial shaded condition. The conventional methods such as hill climbing and incremental conductance methods do not work properly in these conditions. The proposed method is suitable to all conditions with reduced steady-state fluctuations. The overall system is simulated in PSCAD and the effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on various conditions. {\&}copy; The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016.},

abstract = {The chapter deals with the description of Fussy Logic (FL) principles and its application in power electronics and motor-drive systems. The FL is a discipline under Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is basically computer emulation of human thinking (called computational intelligence). The goal of AI is to mimic human intelligence. AI also includes expert systems (ESs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), or neural networks (NNWs), and genetic algorithms (GAs). All of the main areas in AI, except ES, are defined as soft computing. The concept of FL and its characteristics emerge from Zadeh's theory propounded in 1965. Any FL application uses a knowledge base that consists of multivalued membership functions (MFs) describing the fuzzy variables and the rule table consisting of “IF{\ldots} THEN{\ldots} statements.” The knowledge base is developed on the basis of the behavioral nature of the system. The trial-and-error approach of FL algorithms may be time consuming, but user-friendly computer programs (such as the MATLAB-based Fuzzy Logic Toolbox) help speed the process. The applications of FL principles, include speed control of induction motor vector drives, efficiency optimization of induction motor vector drives by flux programming; and wind generation systems, linearization of the transfer characteristics of thyristor converters at discontinuous conduction, induction motor stator resistance estimations, estimation of distorted waveforms and MRAC slip gain tuning control of vector drives.},

@article{Chu2013,
abstract = {This paper investigates the influence of skewing on torque ripples, including the electromagnetic (EM) torque ripple, and the cogging torque, in permanent magnet (PM) machines. It is found that the effectiveness of skewing largely depends on the axial variation of a torque ripple phase but less on its magnitude under skewing. It is further found that, in both linear and nonlinear cases, the EM and the on-load torque ripple cannot be fully eliminated by skewing one on-load torque ripple period or any other angles, except 360° electrical, which is impractical. This is due to the fact that the EM torque ripple, especially its phase, of each slice is different due to the axial variation of the equivalent current phase advance angle introduced by skewing. In nonlinear cases, the EM torque ripple variation is further aggravated by the axial variation of magnetic saturation. The EM torque ripple as well as the on-load torque ripple may be even increased by skewing, especially when the cogging torque is low and electric loading is high.},

abstract = {The thesis deals with the issue of cost reduction in direct-drive generators for wind turbines. Today, the combination gearbox-medium-speed (1000-2000 rpm) induction generator largely dominates the market of MW-scale wind turbines. This is due to the lower costs of the gearbox option compared to the costs of gearless systems. Nevertheless, there is an acute interest among researchers and wind turbine suppliers in the possibility of removing gears and slip rings from the drive train, leading to lower maintenance (no oil is required and slip rings can be avoided) and higher reliability due to the absence of wear between gears.$\backslash$nThe direction followed by the thesis is the investigation and comparison of various permanent magnet (PM) machine topologies. The aim is to identify the topology(ies) with the lowest cost/torque and highest torque/ mass. A new TFPM geometry, called TFPM machine with toothed rotor, is derived in the. The new machine topology has the following characteristics: the stator is single-sided, the rotor PM and flux concentrators are independent from the build-up of mechanical tolerances, the installation of rotor parts (PM and flux concentrators) can be automated and the flux circulation allows laminated steel to be used in the stator core. A prototype of the TFPM machine with toothed rotor is presented. $\backslash$nThe comparison between TFPM machines with toothed rotor and conventional PM synchronous machines is discussed. Comparison of the cost/torque and torque/mass of the two machine topologies for diameters ranging between 0.5 m and 3.0 m showed favorable expected performances of the TFPM machine with toothed rotor for diameters of 0.5 m and 1.0 m. However, diameters larger than 1.0 m favored the conventional PM synchronous machine with/without flux-concentration. $\backslash$nUsing the results of the optimization process, the costs of active material are computed for a 1.5 MW wind turbine. It is found that active material represents about 5{\%} of the total turbine cost, while previous estimates indicated that the generator costs are rather between 30{\%} and 40{\%} of a complete direct-drive wind turbine. Therefore, further optimiza{\^{A}}¬tion of direct-drive machines should also include the costs of manufacturing and the costs of the mechanical structure.},

abstract = {The direct-drive radial flux synchronous generator is considered as the modern wind turbine drive train. Both the electri- cally (e.g., Enercon) and permanent magnet (PM; e.g., Siemens) excited direct-drive generators are gaining popularity on the market today. Compared with the matured geared counterpart, the electrically excited direct-drive generator is heavier and more expensive but more reliable per unit capacity. The PM-excited generator is expensive, is simpler in electrome- chanical design, has a high power-to-weight ratio, and yields a higher energy conversion efficiency than its electrically excited equivalent. The PM generator technology has the potential to yield the highest energy-to-cost ratio. However, standardization of this direct-drive generator parts/subassemblies may overcome the existing cost barrier.Most current lit- erature focuses on PM generator wind turbine technology, specifically on generator energy conversion optimization, and the scalability of technologies to capacities in access of 5MW. Strangely, PMgenerator's mass and cost reductions through optimized structural design incorporating manufacturing, transportation, and installation constraints are less studied. This paper solely focuses on themechanical and structural design aspects of large radial flux synchronousPMgenerators specific to direct-drive wind turbines. Generator topologies such as the common iron-cored and unconventional air-cored genera- tor are discussed. However, design considerations specific to the iron-cored generator topology are studied. The design considerations investigated involve the geometries and the configurations of rotor/stator active and inactive structures, the interfaces, and the conductor/PM mounting methods.

abstract = {Smart grids are often analyzed using a top-down approach, i.e., starting from communication and control technologies evolution, to then focus on their effects on active and passive users, in terms of new services, higher efficiency and quality of supply. However, with their bottom-up approach, virtual power plants (VPP) are very promising instruments for promoting an effective integration of distributed generation (DG) and energy storage devices as well as valid means for enabling consumers to respond to load management signals, when operated under the supervision of a scheduling coordinator. These aggregation factors can be very profitable for the distributed energy resources (DERs) economy and for the energy network itself. This paper presents a new algorithm to optimize the day-ahead thermal and electrical scheduling of a large scale VPP (LSVPP) which contains: a) many small-scale producers and consumers (“prosumers”) distributed over a large territory and b) energy storage and cogeneration processes. The algorithm also takes into account the actual location of each DER in the public network and their specific capability. Thermal and electrical generator models, load and storage devices are very detailed and flexible, as are the rates and incentives framework. Several novelties, with respect to the previous literature, are proposed. Case study results are also described and discussed},

abstract = {Grid-connected converters employ LCL-filters, instead of simple inductors, because they allow lower inductances while reducing cost and size. Active damping, without dissipative elements, is preferred to passive damping for solving the asso- ciated stability problems. However, large variations in the grid inductance may compromise system stability, and this problem is more severe for parallel converters. This situation, typical of rural areas with solar and wind resources, calls for robust LCL-filter design. This paper proposes a design procedure with remarkable results under severe grid inductance variation. The procedure considers active damping using lead-lag network and capacitor current feedback. Passive damping is also discussed. The design flow, with little iteration and no complex algorithms, selects the proper ratios between the switching and resonance frequency, the grid and converter inductance, and the filter capacitance and total inductance. An estimation for the grid current total harmonic distortion (THD) is also proposed. Simulation and experiments validate the proposals},

For utility-scale PV system, the single-stage scheme is used for high efficiency and simple power converter topology. The proposed MPPT approach utilising a modified particle swarm optimisation method is interrelated with other control schemes. The MPP changes with variation in solar irradiation and temperature. Also, the PV power characteristic of large system is characterised by multiple peaks under partial shaded condition. The conventional methods such as hill climbing and incremental conductance methods do not work properly in these conditions. The proposed method is suitable to all conditions with reduced steady-state fluctuations. The overall system is simulated in PSCAD and the effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on various conditions. {\&}copy; The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016.},

The results of the analysis, based on a simplified analytical model and confirmed by finite element (FE) analysis, show that the two motors have similar rated power but that the SPM motor has barely no overload capability, independently of the available inverter current. Moreover, the loss behavior of the two motors is rather different in the various operating ranges with the SPM one better at low speed due to short end connections but penalized at high speed by the need of a significant deexcitation current. The analysis is validated through FE simulation of two actual motor designs.},

Fully reduced on-state resistance in a new normally-off GaN transistor called Gate Injection Transistor (GIT) greatly helps to increase the efficiency.

abstract = {Thermal management plays a pivotal role in achieving high power densities in converters. Improvement on thermal performance of critical components in printed-circuit board (PCB) assembled switch mode converters is achieved by using design techniques that extend across electromagnetic, geometrical, and thermal-integration technologies. For better use of the already available PCB material, three-dimensional component layout and flexible PCB technology are utilized to gain advantages. A theory to evaluate the thermal-management effectiveness of switch mode converters is introduced based on two new figures of merit, namely thermal-management loss density and thermal-design rating. These two figures of merit quantify the effective use of thermal-management material as well as the thermal performance of a converter design. The figure-of-merit criteria allow flexibility so that it can be adjusted to an appropriate design objective. Design objectives include achieving higher power densities or achieving good reliability. The thermal-management-effectiveness theory is applied here to thermally optimize a Flyback converter that has been geometrically integrated. The design technique to adjust the thermal-management effectiveness of integrated switch mode converters to achieve a set objective, by means of the introduced figures of merit, forms the core of the publication, validated by experimental measurements},

Included in the study program was a preliminary feasibility and conceptual design study of a novel, hybrid EML with a pulsed, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator power supply. This concept was evolved by Battelle under an earlier Joint Services Small Arms Program Office effort. The system to be designed was a 0.30 caliber, tactical, portable EML capable of accelerating a 2.5 g projectile to near 1500 m/s, using a 1 m railgun and a solid armature. A first-order performance model for the integrated EML and generator was developed and implemented on a personal computer. Trade studies were conducted on numerous parameters of interest, and required propellant and other characteristics were specified. Results of the model development and trade studies are presented herein, and they indicate that significant technology advances are required to weaponize this EML concept. For the purposes of conducting the necessary para- metric studies, a baseline launcher configuration was specified. A 1 m long generator and a 1 m long railgun were selected, with an average generator channel diameter of 25.4 mm, and a railgun bore diameter of 7.62 mm. Rails and electrodes were taken to be copper for all cases. The downstream 50{\%} of the MHD channel was made active, with the magnetic field provided by external, battery-powered saddle coils. The projectile was initially accelerated by a pressure sufficient that 200 m/s velocity was reached by the time the current is first applied, The baseline generator characteristics were taken as: a 5 T magnetic flux density, a 2000 m/s plasma velocity, and an effective plasma conductivity of 2000 mho/m. With such a generator, a projectile muzzle velocity of 1520 m/s is predicted.},

These challenges are addressed in this paper by logically and statistically utilizing multiple existing cur-rent sensors and current signals to make an accurate detection, and statistical/adaptive threshold for precise detection and deci-sion making. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been mathematically and theoretically proved under modeled Gaussian noise conditions.

The controller is of the finite control set (FCS) type, which takes the discrete states of the voltage source inverter (VSI) into account. Each sampling period, the future behavior of the plant is predicted and inputs (voltage vectors) are selected using an optimization criterion, i.e., a cost function. Optimization, however, depend on the operation region. Maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) tracking for high electrical efficiency is aimed below rated speed, operation off the MTPA trajectory is necessary for obtaining field-weakening. In this work, a cost function is designed, which is suitable for operation at high speeds without penalizing operation below rated speed. MP-DTC is applied to permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drive systems. High control performances, i.e., dynamics, is obtained without increasing the switching frequency nor reducing significantly the torque quality. This feature is interesting above all for high power applications. The proposed control strategy has been evaluated on a small-scale (PMSM) drive system with two-level VSI for demonstration showing promising results.},

abstract = {A dynamic particle swarm optimization with learning strategy (DPSO-LS) is proposed for key parameter estimation for permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs), where the voltage-source inverter (VSI) nonlinearities are taken into account in the parameter estimation model and can be estimated simultaneously with other machine parameters. In the DPSO-LS algorithm, a novel movement modification equation with variable exploration vector is designed to effectively update particles, enabling swarms to cover large areas of search space with large probability and thus the global search ability is enhanced. Moreover, a Gaussian-distribution-based dynamic opposition-based learning strategy is developed to help the pBest jump out local optima. The proposed DPSO-LS can significantly enhance the estimator model accuracy and dynamic performance. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to multiple parameter estimation including the VSI nonlinearities of a PMSM. The performance of DPSO-LS is compared with several existing PSO algorithms, and the comparison results show that the proposed parameters estimation method has better performance in tracking the variation of machine parameters effectively and estimating the VSI nonlinearities under different operation conditions.},

Since the fault progression, compared to the dynamics of the measured terminal quantities, can be considered as a slow process, it can be approximately modeled by the step changes of certain model-based parameters, representing fault severity levels. Diag-nosis process can reliably detect the fault occurrence and severity changes, from the incipient stage of fault development, by which the parameter estimation and prognosis process, leading to cal-culation of remaining useful life, can be promptly commenced. A generic method using multiple fault indicators for diagnosis and particle filter for prognosis is proposed for electrical machines un-der stator winding interturn fault. The proposed framework is experimentally validated using real machine signatures consisting of only stator voltage and current measurements.

Direct driven permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), which has the advantages of high drive train efficiency and high reliability, is promising in wind turbine applications, especially offshore. It is known, that direct driven PMSG is heavier than its geared counterparts, which increases the cost and may bring up engineering challenges. Integrating the active parts of PMSG with the blades, hub or nacelle and sharing the carrying structures can give considerable reduction of the top head mass. Integrated design challenges the electromagnetic and thermal analysis of PMSG from the perspective of whole system and the design approach may differ from the conventional. This paper presents an overview of the modeling methods for the design of PMSG. First, the drive train technology is discussed and challenges in the design of PMSG are identified. Secondly, the electromagnetic and thermal design methods are reviewed. Finally, development of simulation software is investigated.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on direct torque control (DTC) for three-phase AC electric drives. A novel model predictive control scheme is proposed that keeps the motor torque, the stator flux, and (if present) the inverter's neutral point potential within given hysteresis bounds while minimizing the switching frequency of the inverter. Based on an internal model of the drive, the controller predicts several future switch transitions, extrapolates the output trajectories, and chooses the sequence of inverter switch positions (voltage vectors) that minimizes the switching frequency. The advantages of the proposed controller are twofold. First, as underlined by the experimental results in the second part of this paper, it yields a superior performance with respect to the industrial state of the art. Specifically, the switching frequency is reduced by up to 50{\%} while the torque and flux are kept more accurately within their bounds. Moreover, the fast dynamic torque response is inherited from standard DTC. Second, the scheme is applicable to a large class of (three-phase) AC electric machines driven by inverters.},

While many electric vehicles (Evs) are on the market, they are not as cost competitive as conventional vehicles, and affordable cost is necessary for large-scale market penetration. For this to become a reality, continued research is needed to develop new cost-efficient technologies. this article presents the met-rics and benchmarks used to gauge the performance of various electric drive-trains. in addition, current state-of-the-art technologies are presented in terms of these metrics as well as the future goals and trends in the industry. With ongoing january/february 2017  IEEE Industry Applications Magazine 15 development, the market for electric and hybrid vehicles will continue to increase. Automotive Industry Advancements the Ev and hybrid-electric-vehicle (hEv) market has been growing over the years and continues to grow today. influenced by both government regulations and consumer demand, auto manufacturers have continued to pursue technologies to improve efficiency and fuel economy. as the market progresses, continued research and develop-ment are required to enable the large-scale market pene-tration of Evs and hEvs in the future. in particular, there are three main areas in which current research aims to improve the vehicle: electric motors, power electronics, and energy storage. this article describes the evolution of these technologies and lays out the road map for future technological development and implementation in Evs and hEvs [1], [2]. Evs can trace their inception as far back as the early 20th century; however, they were quickly overmatched by the influx of the internal-combustion engine (icE). the advantage that the icE had was its energy-storage capaci-ty; as it was capable of providing longer ranges of travel at a lower fuel cost. however, by the end of the 20th century, technological improvements in electric machines, power electronics, and energy storage sparked increased efforts in Ev development. today, Evs and hEvs have a consider-able share of the automotive marketplace, which is led by major car companies around the world. new technologies will continue to revolutionize the industry and lead to large-scale adaptations of these cars [3], [4]. apart from technology trends, this article will also present perfor-mance requirements that have been set for the future. cur-rent and potential future states of the state-of-the-art technologies will be described, as updated from those dis-cussed in [25].},

The full-feedforward function of the grid voltages in the stationary {\&}{\#}x03B1;-{\&}{\#}x03B2; frame for a three-phase grid-connected inverter with an LCL filter is proposed. This full-feedforward function consists of three parts, which is proportional part, derivative part and second derivative part. With the proposed full-feedforward scheme of the grid voltages, approximately zero steady-state error of the injected grid currents at line frequency can be achieved even with proportional-integral (PI) compensators as the injected grid current regulators in the stationary {\&}{\#}x03B1;-{\&}{\#}x03B2; frame. The injected grid current distortion and unbalance caused by the grid voltages are also greatly reduced. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed full-feedforward scheme is verified by the experimental results.},

abstract = {As the development and installation of photovoltaic (PV) systems are still growing at an exceptionally rapid pace, relevant grid integration policies are going to change consequently in order to accept more PV systems in the grid. The next generation PV systems will play an even more active role like what the conventional power plants do today in the grid regulation participation. Requirements of ancillary services like Low-Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) associated with reactive current injection and voltage support through reactive power control, have been in effectiveness in some countries. Those advanced features can be provided by next-generation PV systems, and will be enhanced in the future to ensure an even efficient and reliable utilization of PV systems. In the light of this, Reactive Power Injection (RPI) strategies for single-phase PV systems are explored in this paper. The RPI possibilities are: a) constant average active power control, b) constant active current control, c) constant peak current control and d) thermal optimized control strategy. All those strategies comply with the currently active grid codes, but are with different objectives. The thermal optimized control strategy is demonstrated on a 3 kW single-phase PV system by simulations. The other three RPI strategies are verified experimentally on a 1 kW singe-phase system in LVRT operation mode. Those results show the effectiveness and feasibilities of the proposed strategies with reactive power control during LVRT operation. The design and implementation considerations for the characterized strategies are also discussed.},

abstract = {SSPAs are largely used in Navigation and Telecom satellites. Some Payloads may require more than 100 off SSPAs. In this case, most of the payload power is used to supply these SSPAs. EPCs (Electronic Power Conditioner) supplying these SSPAs are then high performance DC/DC converters. Mass and efficiency are the 2 drivers for these DC/DC converters as they could be numerous on a satellite. Usually, these EPCs were presented as modules outside of the SSPA. It has appeared that some mass can be saved if the EPC could be implemented in the same chassis as the SSPA. This paper details the solutions developed for a 60W EPC to be delivered as a PCB without mechanical frame. Parts are selected to cope with thermal management of the PCB embedded in the SSPA host chassis. EPC switching frequency has been optimized to reduce losses without increasing too largely the size of the filtering elements. The main performances achieved by this 60W EPC are detailed and illustrated by measurements recorded on one EM board.},

abstract = {For permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs), accurate
magnet flux linkage information is critical for permanent magnet
condition monitoring and drive performance improvement. This paper
proposes a novel particle-filter-based magnet flux linkage estimation
approach by using the harmonics in the machine speed. In the proposed
approach, the harmonic current is first injected to change the speed
harmonics, and the particle filter is then applied to estimate the
magnet flux linkage from the speed harmonics. With a proper selection of
injected harmonic current, it is capable of simultaneously estimating
the magnet flux linkage and reducing the torque ripples as well as the
speed ripples. The proposed approach is based on the machine mechanical
equation, so it is not influenced by the magnetic saturation, the
resistance variation, and the inverter nonlinearity. Specifically, at
first, a novel state-space model is developed based on the machine
mechanical equation, which models the relation between the magnet flux
linkage and the speed harmonic. The state-space model is nonlinear, so
the particle filter is employed for a magnet flux linkage estimation.
Our particle-filter-based estimation approach is validated on a
laboratory PMSM drive system under different loads, speeds, and
temperatures.},

Moreover, a single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) buck converter hardware prototype is developed and the proposed control methods are implemented. Four test cases are conducted based on this prototype.

abstract = {Increasing power system flexibility by responsive demand is a central issue for the incorporation of higher levels of variable wind generation in future power systems. The electrification of the heat sector, except from energy efficiency gains, may offer a vast potential of new forms of flexible demand, by time-shifting of heat production in buildings. The assessment of this potential can, however, be performed only when the limitations imposed by the primary operation of the equipment (space heating) are realistically taken into account. In this paper, a methodology is presented for the quantification of the flexibility offered by the thermal storage of building stock equipped with heat pumps, to power systems with significant penetration of wind power. A model is proposed for the incorporation of the building stock thermal behavior as equivalent energy storage in electricity market models. At the same time, the model allows the coupling to a detailed dynamic thermal model of buildings for the assessment of the respective operational restrictions. The case study presents the results of a project for the evaluation of the flexibility offered by portfolios of high heat pump deployment in conjunction with high wind penetration scenarios for the future German electricity system.},

abstract = {—To develop a reliable permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) controller for electric vehicle application, detec-tion of permanent-magnet (PM) demagnetization conditions is of significance. This paper explores the use of torque ripple for on-line PM demagnetization fault diagnosis using continuous wavelet transforms (CWT) and grey system theory (GST). First, a torque-ripple-based rotor flux linkage detection model considering electro-magnetic noises is proposed, which employs CWT filtering, wavelet ridge spectrum, and torque ripple energy extraction. This model is able to reveal the torque variation and eliminate the effect of elec-tromagnetic interferences. Second, GST is employed to facilitate the detection of demagnetization ratios and torque ripple energy pulsations caused by demagnetization. Third, a current regulation strategy is proposed to minimize the torque ripples induced by PM demagnetization, which contributes to making the approach feasi-ble to interior PMSM (IPMSM). Furthermore, the proposed real-time irreversible demagnetization detection approach can identify the demagnetization fault under different operating conditions. The proposed approach and current regulation strategy are exper-imentally verified on a down-scaled laboratory IPMSM.

abstract = {A drive based on a matrix power converter for a 30 kW totally enclosed, fan cooled induction motor was developed to be fully integrated within the spatial envelope of the motor, located inside the end cover at the fan end of the machine. This paper describes the thermal design of the motor to dissipate the losses from the drive, which were approximately a third of those from the motor. The power electronic components were mounted on the inside of a new end cover which was equipped with an extensive array of fins cooled by air from the external fan. The electronic components were insulated from the air in the end region of the motor. A heat sink plate was installed within the motor behind the end cover to conduct the heat from the motor that would otherwise have been dissipated through the end cover. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to model the ventilation and heat transfer from the new end cover and to develop improved fan geometries. It was concluded that CFD can be used effectively to design motor cooling systems. An improved fan geometry was designed to keep the power electronics cool under high ambient temperatures with the motor running at full load},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the effects of the input voltage unbalance and sags on the dc-bus electrolytic capacitors in adjustable-speed drives (ASDs) in order to predict their impact on expected capacitor lifetime. The key phenomenon that causes these problems is the transition of the rectifier stage from three-phase to single-phase operation. Since the equivalent series resistance increases at low frequencies, the low-order harmonic current components (e.g., 120 and 240 Hz) contribute disproportionately to the capacitor power losses and temperature rise, resulting in reduced lifetime. Closed-form expressions are developed for predicting these effects including the impact of finite line impedance, finite bus capacitance, and varying load. The impact of inverter space-vector pulsewidth-modulation switching on the capacitor loss is also included. Simulations and experimental tests are used to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the closed-form analysis using a 5-hp ASD system},

Most alternatives have brushless generators and full converters. One of them is the direct-drive system. If the availability of permanent magnet materials can be guaranteed, permanent-magnet generators are considered as the most suitable direct-drive generators. The increasing importance of offshore wind energy results in an increasing attention for reliability and availability.},

abstract = {High penetration of wind generation will increase the requirement for fast frequency response services as currently wind plants do not provide inertial response. Although the importance of inertia reduction has been widely recognized, its impact on the system scheduling has not been fully investigated. In this context, this paper proposes a novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for stochastic unit commitment that optimizes system operation by simultaneously scheduling energy production, standing/spinning reserves and inertia-dependent fast frequency response in light of uncertainties associated with wind production and generation outages. Post-fault dynamic frequency requirements, rate of change of frequency, frequency nadir and quasi-steady-state frequency are formulated as MILP constraints by using the simplified model of system dynamics. Moreover the proposed methodology enables the impact of wind uncertainty on system inertia to be considered. Case studies are carried out on the 2030 Great Britain system to demonstrate the importance of incorporating inertia-dependent fast frequency response in the stochastic scheduling and to indicate the potential for the proposed model to inform reviews of grid codes associated with fast frequency response and future development of inertia-related market.},

The heat exchange between the heat transfer fluid and the PCM and its phase change are investigated. Under simplifying assumptions, it is shown that the governing equations are the three energy conservation equations written for the heat transfer fluid, the wall and the PCM. The PCM energy conservation equation is written in terms of enthalpy. All three parabolic differential equations are numerically solved according to a finite difference approach implemented in MATLAB language. The simulations are conducted in order to derive the temperature profiles inside the PCM and to estimate the time needed to complete the melting of the PCM. Different simulation campaigns are conducted varying the inlet temperature of the heat transfer fluid. The obtained results can be used as guidelines for more careful studies of the thermal storage system and for subsequent analysis and optimization processes.},

The unit commitment problem with spinning reserve for MG is considered in this new method. The total cost function, which includes the cost of ESS, cost of output power and cost of spinning reserve, is introduced. The effectiveness of the approach is validated by a case study where the optimal ESS rating for MG is determined. The quantitative results show that the ESS with an optimal size is not only storing renewable energy and re-dispatching it appropriately, but also saving the the total cost for MG. The main method is formulated as a mixed nonlinear integer problem (MNIP), which is solved in AMPL (A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming).},

The test pattern the semiconductor is unique in that the effects of contact resistance are accumulated over the pattern, nearly unencumbered by voltage and current probes which might other- wise influence the current flow. Measurements of contact resistivities for typical solar cell metallizations using this technique are reported to be in the mid n-cm2 range. The relative importance contact of resistance compared to other sources of power loss in a solar cell is determined for a typical contact system. Expressions derived in order to make this comparison are useful for evaluating cell contact system. Values of series resistance calculated using these expressions are compared with measured values.},

abstract = {A superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) is an attractive power supply for electromagnetic rail launchers (EMRL), which require pulse currents to launch projectiles at very high speeds. Moreover, the accelerating force in an EMRL may be enhanced by adding a background field, a principle known as launcher S3EL concept (Superconducting Self-Supplied Electromagnetic Launcher) consists in using the SMES both as a power supply and for background field generation. The challenge is to reach the operating current and peak magnetic field of such launchers, which can be up to hundreds of kA and up to 10 T. The use of a high-temperature superconductor is mandatory to maintain superconducting operation during a launch, though operation at 4.2 K is foreseen to benefit from the RareEarth-BaCuO (REBCO) tape high critical current densities. The aim of this work is to derive a practical design for a 1-m-long small-scale S3EL proof of concept using REBCO coated conductor, with a reduced output velocity (100 m/s). After preliminary sizing studies, the spatial constraints for the SMES-Launcher integration is presented. A parametric joint analytical and Finite Element Method (FEM) study is conducted to refine the design and maximize the operation margins while maintaining the launch performances. Finally, cable design and discharge method suitable to reach the required operating current are presented. {\textcopyright} 2002-2011 IEEE.},

This paper focuses on development of a control strategy for optimal use of the BESS for this purpose. The paper considers an open-loop optimal control scheme to incorporate the operating constraints of the BESS, such as state of charge limits, charge/discharge current limits, and lifetime. The goal of the control is to have the BESS to provide as much smoothing as possible, so that the wind farm can be dispatched on an hourly basis based on the forecasted wind conditions. The effectiveness of this control strategy has been tested by using an actual wind farm data. Furthermore, a real-time implementation strategy using model predictive control is also proposed. Finally, it is shown that the control strategy is very important in improving the BESS performance for this application.},

abstract = {Most railgun experiments exhibit transition to high-voltage contact after the applied current starts to decrease from its peak value. A statistical examination of existing data revealed that such contact transitions occur at approximately 80{\%} of peak current during down-slope. While several plausible explanations exist for the cause of such transition, we demonstrate through numerical simulation that a likely cause of this transition mechanism is a diffusion-controlled process that reduces the contact pressure below the threshold value necessary to carry the applied current. The current down-slope was found to result in a nonuniform body-force-density distribution in the armature such that the contact pressure at the armature-rail interface decreases (eventually becoming zero) even though the total electromagnetic force resulting from the applied current is still compressive. This event's diffusive nature suggests that transition can be delayed by controlling the diffusion time, either by judicious material grading or increasing the diffusion depth},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel methodology for comparing thermal energy storage to electrochemical, chemical, and mechanical energy storage technologies. The underlying physics of this model is hinged on the development of a round trip efficiency formulation for these systems. The charging and discharging processes of compressed air energy storage, flywheel energy storage, fuel cells, and batteries are well understood and defined from a physics standpoint in the context of comparing these systems. However, the challenge lays in comparing the charging process of these systems with the charging process of thermal energy storage systems for concentrating solar power plants (CSP). The round trip efficiency and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) are the metrics used for comparison purposes. The thermal energy storage system is specifically compared to vanadium redox, sodium sulphur, and compressed air energy storage (CAES) systems from a large scale storage perspective of 100's of MWh. The rationale behind this analysis was to develop an electrical storage efficiency for molten salt thermal energy storage systems, such that it can be compared to battery energy storage technologies in the context of comparing CSP with thermal energy storage to solar photovoltaic with battery storage from a utility scale perspective. The results from the modelling using Andasol 3 CSP plant as a case study yield a storage efficiency of 86{\%} and LCOE of {\$}216/MWh. The results of this modelling will facilitate the future generation of a thermal energy storage roadmap.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.The superconducting inductive pulsed-power supply (SPPS) circuit consists of a high-temperature superconducting pulsed-power transformer (HTSPPT) and an auxiliary capacitor. The electrical losses and the power of the primary source can be cut down with the superconducting inductive energy storage. Although its energy density is slightly less than a purely superconducting inductive system, it can reduce the maximum voltage of the opening switch by the capacitor and achieve a high degree of current amplification factor. However, during the discharge process, the magnetic leakage flux energy stored in the primary of the HTSPPT requires the capacitor to have a certain capacity. The higher the ratio of the capacitive stored energy over the total inductive stored energy, the more the dominant position of inductive energy storage reduces. The current amplification factor ($\gamma$), the maximum voltage of the opening switch (VS max), and the ratio of capacitive stored energy ($\eta$) are the three main properties of the SPPS circuit, which depends on several intertwined critical parameters, such as the inductance ratio n = L2/(L2+LL) and the capacitance (C1). This paper studies the influence of the critical parameters on the main circuit performance with a 1-kJ SPPS system. The detailed selection method of the critical parameters for the specific system is also discussed with a coupling coefficient of 0.95. Such a system is easy to be utilized for the basic experimental study of a small railgun.},

The PCB stator has simplified the design and construction and avoids unnecessary space, since size reduction has become one of the most important aspects of flywheel motor design for nanosatellites. The performances of the machine are estimated by combination method of three-dimensional (3D) electromagnetic finite element analysis (FEA) and approximate theoretical analysis. The back EMF and electromagnetic torque are derived. A comparison between the analysis and experimental measurement results of the prototype machine is also presented.

The optimized power point tracking (OPPT) controller, which shifts the turbine operating point from the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) curve to the virtual inertia control (VIC) curves according to the frequency deviation, is proposed to release the “hidden” kinetic energy and provide dynamic frequency support to the grid. The effects of the VIC on power oscillation damping capability are theoretically evaluated. Compared to the conventional supplementary derivative regulator-based inertia control, the proposed control scheme can not only provide fast inertial response, but also increase the system damping capability during transient events. Thus, inertial response and power oscillation damping function can be obtained in a single controller by the proposed OPPT control. A prototype three-machine system containing two synchronous generators and a PMSG-based wind turbine with 31{\%} of wind penetration is tested to validate the proposed control strategy on providing rapid inertial response and enhanced system damping.},

abstract = {—Condition monitoring is used for early detection of incipient faults in electrical machines. Accurate modeling and sim-ulation of the faulty machines can help to design effective condition monitoring systems. Three-phase synchronous machines (TSMs) are widely used for electrical power generation at power plants. Winding function theory offers effective, quick, and rather simple method for modeling and simulation of faulty electrical machines; however, this method only includes real windings of the machine. Rotor damping effects have important role in dynamic perfor-mance of the TSMs. Fictitious short-circuited windings (damper windings) on the rotor direct and quadrature axes are used to model these effects in the Park's vector model. This paper offers an approach to include similar damper windings in the winding function approach for modeling TSMs with interturn fault in the stator winding. Simulation results show creation or amplification of some frequency components in the stator line current as well as the rotor field current due to the interturn fault whose frequen-cies are equal to the rotor speed and its integer multiples. The frequency components are also present in the circulating fault cur-rent within the shorted turns. Experimental results approve the simulation results.

In order to determine critical parameters concerning the transition of brush armatures, a series of experiments was performed using the ISL-EMA3 railgun (DES, 3 m, 15{\&}times;30 mm2, 620 kJ). The maximum muzzle velocity obtained during these experiments was about 1200 m/s. A qualitative model of brush-rail contact, assuming that contact transition is mainly due to mass loss of brushes, is presented. The mechanisms causing mass loss were investigated.

The PCM energy conservation equation is written in terms of enthalpy. All three parabolic differential equations are numerically solved according to a finite difference approach implemented in MATLAB language. The simulations are conducted in order to derive the temperature profiles inside the PCM and to estimate the time needed to complete the melting of the PCM. Different simulation campaigns are conducted varying the inlet temperature of the heat transfer fluid.

abstract = {This thesis presents an alternative approach to the analytical design of surface-mounted axialflux permanent-magnet machines. Emphasis has been placed on the design of axial-flux machines with a one-rotor-two-stators configuration. The design model developed in this study incorporates facilities to include both the electromagnetic design and thermal design of the machine as well as to take into consideration the complexity of the permanent-magnet shapes, which is a typical requirement for the design of high-performance permanent-magnet motors. A prototype machine with rated 5 kW output power at 300 min-1 rotation speed has been designed and constructed for the purposesof ascertaining the results obtained from the analytical design model. A comparative study of low-speed axial-flux and low-speed radial-flux permanent-magnet machines is presented. The comparative study concentrates on 55 kW machines with rotation speeds 150 min-1, 300 min-1 and 600 min-1 and is based on calculated designs. A novel comparison method is introduced. The method takes into account the mechanical constraints of the machine and enables comparison of the designed machines, with respect to the volume, efficiency and cost aspects of each machine. It is shown that an axial-flux permanent-magnet machine with one-rotor-two-stators configuration has generally a weaker efficiency than a radial-flux permanent-magnet machine if for all designs the same electric loading, air-gap flux density and current density have been applied. On the other hand, axial-flux machines are usually smaller in volume, especially when compared to radial-flux machines for which the length ratio (axial length of stator stack vs. air-gap diameter)is below 0.5. The comparison results show also that radial-flux machines with alow number of pole pairs, p {\textless} 4, outperform the corresponding axial-flux machines.},

abstract = {Cogging torque in permanent-magnet machines causes torque and speed ripples, as well as acoustic noise and vibration, especially in low speed and direct drive applications. In this paper, a general analytical expression for cogging torque is derived by the energy method and the Fourier series analysis, based on the air gap permeance and the flux density distribution in an equivalent slotless machine. The optimal design parameters, such as slot number and pole number combination, skewing, pole-arc to pole-pitch ratio, and slot opening, are derived analytically to minimize the cogging torque. Finally, the finite-element analysis is adopted to verify the correctness of analytical methods.},

abstract = {This paper presents a digital optimal battery charger that has an inherent characteristics of detecting the fault (main switch failure, i.e., TOP FET failure of the converter) within one switching cycle. The charger consists of synchronous buck converter and a novel carrier generation (synthetic ripple) based digital feedback clamped hysteretic modulator. The proposed charger charges the battery with the constant current for less battery state of charge (SOC) and charges it with the constant voltage when the battery SOC reaches near 100{\%}. The charger facilitates smooth and stable transition from constant current (CC) mode to constant voltage (CV) mode without the need of extra switch or control loop. The novel feedback clamped digital hysteretic modulator used in the charger generates carrier to the hysteretic comparator in the field programmable gate array (FPGA) based digital domain by generating piece-wise linear synthetic ripple using sensed converter voltages (switch node voltage and the output voltage), without the need of direct inductor current sensing and adding the output voltage to it. The regulation loop is clamped and hence the charger remains in the feedback controlled during the whole charging cycle. Experimental and simulation results verify the operation of the proposed charging system on 20 W prototype. The performance of the charger is verified on a 6 V-4.5 Ah lead acid battery as well.},

abstract = {The standard voltage source inverter (VSI), widely used in electric vehicle/hybrid electric vehicle (EV/HEV) traction drives, requires a bulky dc bus capacitor to absorb the large switching ripple currents and prevent them from shortening the battery's life. The dc bus capacitor presents a significant barrier to meeting inverter cost, volume, and weight requirements for mass production of affordable EVs/HEVs. The large ripple currents become even more problematic for the film capacitors (the capacitor technology of choice for EVs/HEVs) in high temperature environments as their ripple current handling capability decreases rapidly with rising temperatures. It is shown in previous work that segmenting the VSI based traction drive system can significantly decrease the ripple currents and thus the size of the dc bus capacitor. This paper presents an integrated packaging scheme to reduce the system cost of a segmented traction drive.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the capacitor-current-feedback active damping for the digitally controlled LCL-type grid-connected inverter. It turns out that proportional feedback of the capacitor current is equivalent to virtual impedance connected in parallel with the filter capacitor due to the computation and pulse width modulation (PWM) delays. The LCL-filter resonance frequency is changed by this virtual impedance. If the actual resonance frequency is higher than one-sixth of the sampling frequency (fs/6), where the virtual impedance contains a negative resistor component, a pair of open-loop unstable poles will be generated. As a result, the LCL-type grid-connected inverter becomes much easier to be unstable if the resonance frequency is moved closer to fs/6 due to the variation of grid impedance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a capacitor-current-feedback active damping with reduced computation delay, which is achieved by shifting the capacitor current sampling instant towards the PWM reference update instant. With this method, the virtual impedance exhibits more like a resistor in a wider frequency range, and the open-loop unstable poles are removed; thus, high robustness against the grid-impedance variation is acquired. Experimental results from a 6-kW prototype confirm the theoretical expectations.},

abstract = {The in-field validation of wind turbines behavior is very time consuming and cost intensive, especially when fault ride-through (FRT) tests are conducted. Full-size wind-turbine test benches allow a realistic operation of wind turbines in an artificial environment. Due to the independency of wind and grid conditions, the cost and duration of the test program and certification can be reduced. This paper presents the development of 4 MW full-size wind-turbine test bench following a multi-physics hardware in-the-loop (HiL) concept. With the currently installed test bench setup, a synchronization of the device-under-test converters is possible. Through the measurement results of the test programs conducted on the test bench, the capability of the test bench in replicating the field conditions is demonstrated. In addition, a time consuming efficiency measurement can be performed with the reduced duration on the test bench. This shows another main benefit of the test bench compared to the conventional test method for wind turbines. {\&}copy; 2015 IEEE.},

In this work, we develop a Particle Filter-based (PF) prognostic model for the estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aluminum electrolytic capacitors used in electrical automotive drives, whose operation is characterized by continuously varying conditions. The capacitor degradation process, which remarkably depends from the temperature experienced by the component, is typically monitored by observing the capacitor Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR). However, the ESR measurement is influenced by the temperature at which the measurement is performed, which changes depending on the operating conditions. To address this problem, we introduce a novel degradation indicator independent from the measurement temperature. Such indicator can, then, be used for the prediction of the capacitor degradation and its RUL. For this, we develop a Particle Filter prognostic model, whose performance is verified on data collected in simulated and experimental degradation tests.},

In this way the stiffness requirements of the rotor and the stator are drastically reduced, which leads to large mass savings in the mechanical structure and enables a further diameter increase, which then results in mass reductions also in electrically active parts. The design is based on excitation by use of rare-earth permanent magnets. In other aspects the electrical design is conventional.},

After determining criticality, the maintenance strategy and tasks are analyzed and determined based on failure modes and failure rates.

Preliminary solid modeling and structural analysis of the integrated launch package was performed in order to quantify parasitic mass. Inductance gradient calculations were based on a current density distribution analysis. A PFN/Launcher numerical simulation model was then used to determine linear current density and PFN size. Finally, barrel mass was estimated by structural analysis based on calculated rail repulsive forces. Trends and sensitivities of the different parameters to changes in the bore and rail geometries are presented and conclusions are given.},

abstract = {Electricity generated from renewable sources, which has shown remarkable growth worldwide, can rarely provide immediate response to demand as these sources do not deliver a regular supply easily adjustable to consumption needs. Thus, the growth of this decentralized production means greater network load stability problems and requires energy storage, generally using lead batteries, as a potential solution. However, lead batteries cannot withstand high cycling rates, nor can they store large amounts of energy in a small volume. That is why other types of storage technologies are being developed and implemented. This has led to the emergence of storage as a crucial element in the management of energy from renewable sources, allowing energy to be released into the grid during peak hours when it is more valuable. The work described in this paper highlights the need to store energy in order to strengthen power networks and maintain load levels. There are various types of storage methods, some of which are already in use, while others are still in development. We have taken a look at the main characteristics of the different electricity storage techniques and their field of application (permanent or portable, long- or short-term storage, maximum power required, etc.). These characteristics will serve to make comparisons in order to determine the most appropriate technique for each type of application. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a stator design that consists of a combination of an alternate slot winding and dummy slots to minimize pulsating torque in surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motors. The alternate arrangement of winding coils is designed to eliminate a harmonic component of back electromotive force that gives rise to a harmonic component of pulsating torque. However, the non-uniform arrangement of slots decreases the frequency of the cogging torque by half and may aggravate torque pulsation. To compensate for the drawback or the decrease in the frequency of the cogging torque, dummy slots are introduced in the alternately slotted stator. A theoretical method is developed for the proposed stator combination. The proposed stator design is applied to a prototype in combination with other rotor magnet design techniques, such as magnet shifting and the adjustment of magnet width, to minimize pulsating torque. The results show that the designed motor reduces the ripple factor of the torque by approximately 30{\%} relative to the original value. In addition, the proposed alternate slot winding is validated by comparing the design with equal slot-winding designs optimized through finite-element method analysis.},

abstract = {With rapid development of wind power technologies and significant growth of wind power capacity installed worldwide, various wind generator systems have been developed and built. The objective of this paper is to evaluate various wind generator systems by optimization designs and comparisons. In this paper, seven variable speed constant frequency (VSCF) wind generator systems are investigated, namely permanent magnet synchronous generators with the direct-driven (PMSG-DD), the single-stage gearbox (PMSG-1G) and three-stage gearbox (PMSG-3G) concepts, doubly fed induction generators with the three-stage gearbox (DFIG-3G) and with the single-stage gearbox (DFIG-1G), the electricity excited synchronous generator with the direct-driven (EESG-DD), and the VSCF squirrel cage induction generator with the three-stage gearbox (SCIG-3G). Firstly, the design models of wind turbines, three/single stage gearbox and power electronic converter are presented; design optimizations of the investigated wind generator systems are developed with an improved genetic algorithm. Next, the optimization designs are implemented of various wind generator systems at 0.75-MW, 1.5-MW, 3.0-MW, 5.0-MWand 10MW, respectively. The annual energy production (AEP) per cost are evaluated for a given wind climate. The comparative results show the wind generator system with the single-stage gearbox could be the most attractive choice, especially the DFIG-1G system.},

abstract = {Gallium Nitride High Electron Mobility Transistor (GaN HEMT) is an emerging wide band gap power device in recent years. Using a cascoded structure, the GaN HEMT can be combined with a low voltage MOSFET to make the combination behave as a normally-off device. This paper investigates the soft-switching behavior of cascode GaN HEMT in the phase-leg structure. The analysis reveals some internal device behaviors during the soft-switching transition, which are not found in the non-cascode device. Due to the internal feedback of the cascode structure, the channel current of the internal GaN HEMT drops to zero quickly, leading to extremely low turn-off loss. However, it has been found that there are switching energy loss dissipated in the internal GaN HEMT during the turn-on transient, although the external waveforms of the cascode GaN HEMT exhibit zero voltage switching. The fundamental reason is that ratio of the sum of MOSFET output capacitance and internal GaN HEMT input capacitance to the internal GaN HEMT output capacitance is quite low. Based on the simulation, by adding additional capacitance on the gate source terminals of internal GaN HEMT, these losses can be mitigated. Experimental tests using a commercially available GaN device are presented which show nearly 400 mW of loss at 1 MHz switching frequency in four different load current conditions.},

abstract = {The large-scale integration of wind power into modern power systems has set novel challenges for wind turbine modeling and analysis. Accurate modeling of different wind turbine technologies is becoming a necessity as wind turbines replace conventional units in the production side. This paper describes models for two major variable speed wind turbine types - namely Electrically Excited Synchronous Generator (EESG) and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG). Steady state principles of both types are analyzed and mathematical modeling of crucial components is described. The behavior and operation of the system during stochastic wind speed series is simulated using software tools Matlab and Power Factory. The two configurations are accessed based both on the steady state characteristics and the control system designs. The paper covers a wide range of control methods, which are implemented in both wind turbine schemes. Regarding the PMSG scheme, an advanced damping controller to damp possible oscillations excited in the drive train is presented and its contribution to the safe operation of the wind turbine is explained. In the alternative direct drive scheme (EESG) three different control methods applied in the electrical system are presented.},

However, the performance of these systems is deteriorated when the utility grid voltage experiences abnormal conditions such as voltage harmonics and imbalances. Several advanced control solutions have been recently introduced to cope with this problem but at the cost of a significant increase in the control computational load. This paper first analyzes the limitations of the standard resonant current control operating under abnormal grid conditions and then introduces a control scheme that improves the current harmonic distortion in such adverse conditions without increasing the computational load of the standard current control. This theoretical contribution is validated by means of selected experimental results from a three-phase PV inverter.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an improved analytical switching process model to calculate the switching loss of low-voltage enhancement-mode Gallium Nitride high-electron mobility transistors (eGaN HEMTs). The presented eGaN HEMTs models are more or less derived from silicon MOSFETs models, whereas eGaN HEMTs are different from three aspects: higher switching speed, much more reduced parasitic inductance in switching loop, and absence of reverse recovery. Applying the traditional model to eGaN HEMTs results in inaccurate prediction of switching waveforms and losses. The proposed model considers the effect of low-parasitic inductances, nonlinearity of junction capacitances, and nonlinearity of transconductance. The turn-on and turn-off switching processes are described in detail and the resulting equations can be easily solved. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by comparing the predicted switching waveforms and converter's efficiency with the experimental results, respectively. Based on the analytical model, the effects of gate resistance, gate supply voltage, and parasitic inductances on switching losses are investigated. Meanwhile, a novel current measuring method based on magnetic coupling is proposed to measure the switching current waveform with improved accuracy.},

abstract = {A drive based on a matrix power converter for a 30 kW totally enclosed, fan cooled induction motor was developed to be fully integrated within the spatial envelope of the motor, located inside the end cover at the fan end of the machine. This paper describes the thermal design of the motor to dissipate the losses from the drive, which were approximately a third of those from the motor. The power electronic components were mounted on the inside of a new end cover which was equipped with an extensive array of fins cooled by air from the external fan. The electronic components were insulated from the air in the end region of the motor. A heat sink plate was installed within the motor behind the end cover to conduct the heat from the motor that would otherwise have been dissipated through the end cover. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to model the ventilation and heat transfer from the new end cover and to develop improved fan geometries. It was concluded that CFD can be used effectively to design motor cooling systems. An improved fan geometry was designed to keep the power electronics cool under high ambient temperatures with the motor running at full load},

In many MPC problems, a long prediction horizon is required to ensure an adequate closed-loop performance in steady state and to avoid stability issues. However, the computational effort of solving the optimization problem underlying MPC problems with long prediction horizons is often very great, making the implementation of such schemes in real time a difficult and challenging task. To overcome this difficulty, three established methodologies are surveyed that yield long prediction horizons with a modest computational burden. Case studies are investigated to substantiate the merits of these schemes. More specifically, for dc?dc boost converters, a move blocking strategy is reviewed, and for ac medium-voltage (MV) drives, both an extrapolation and an event-based horizon strategy are examined.},

Aerospace applications involve essentially safety-critical systems which should be able to overcome hardware or software faults and therefore need to be fault tolerant. A way of achieving this is to introduce variable degrees of redundancy into the system by duplicating one or all of the operations within the system itself. Looking at motor drives, multiphase machines, such as multiphase brushless dc machines, are considered to be good candidates in the design of fault-tolerant aerospace motor drives. This paper introduces a multiphase two-level inverter using a flexible and reliable field-programmable gate-array/digital-signal-processor controller for data acquisition, motor control, and fault monitoring to study the fault tolerance of such systems.},

abstract = {Power conversion systems are dependent on the performance and reliability of static converters. However, they are subject to frequent functional and environmental strains, which can induce failures. The anticipation of these failures is difficult but important so the operation of a system can be halted before a breakdown occurs. In the case of photovoltaic (PV) power plants, the system can be simplified into two distinct blocks: the solar panels/modules and the power inverter. A breakdown in either of these blocks can cause significant downtime in the system. Nevertheless, multiple solar module failures can often be tolerated and not lead to a total breakdown of the entire array, whereas a single component failure in the inverter can lead to a collapse of the entire system. Furthermore, solar panel/module manufacturers often offer warranties of up to 20 years, while warranties for inverters rarely reach the ten-year mark [1]. As such, the overall cost of a PV inverter can increase by a factor of two or three if it undergoes one or two failures during the life of the system. Although the market competition between PV inverter manufacturers has traditionally focused on the efficiency of their product, a failure that induces a downtime of just a few days can easily negate the yield attained through a 1{\%} efficiency improvement. Oversizing the inverter or introducing redundancy into the inverter system is one option to improve reliability; however, often, this is not economical.},

abstract = {Multilevel converters, such as the modular multilevel converter (MMC) or the alternate arm converter (AAC), rely on charged capacitors in their cells to generate their AC voltage waveform. Since the cell capacitors are physically large and occupy approximately half the cell volume, their capacitance must be kept minimal while limiting the voltage fluctuation caused by the current passing periodically through these capacitors. This study proposes a mathematical model which estimates the energy deviation for the stacks of both the MMC and the AAC during steady-state operation under any power factor and for AC voltage magnitude fluctuation of up to ±10{\%}. The analysis is then used to calculate the minimum size for the cell capacitors in order to keep their voltage fluctuation within set boundaries for both topologies. The results show that the MMC requires 39 kJ/MVA of capacitive energy storage under sinusoidal modulation but this reduces with triplen injection modulation. The AAC has a lower requirement for storage in its cells of 11 kJ/MVA but the AAC has a six-pulse DC current ripple which requires a filter estimated to have a further 33{\%} capacitive storage.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The pole phase modulation (PPM) technique is an effective method to extend speed range and torque capabilities for an integrated starter and hybrid electric vehicles applications. In this paper, the five pole-phase combination types of a multiphase induction motor (IM) with 36 stator slots and 36 stator conductors are presented and compared quantitatively by using the time-stepping finite element method (TS-FEM). The 36 stator conductors of the proposed multiphase IM are fed by a 36 leg inverter and the current phase angle and amplitude of each stator conductor can be controlled independently. This paper focuses on the winding connection, the PPM technique and the performance comparative analysis of each pole-phase combination types of the proposed multiphase IM. The flux distribution, air-gap flux density, output torque, core losses and efficiency of five pole-phase combination types have been investigated.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {With an increased number of wind turbine generators (WTGs) connected to an electricity network the system operator may request that they participate in frequency control in the event of a sudden unbalancing of power generated and consumed on the system. In this paper the frequency response capability of the full converter variable speed wind turbine generator (FCWTG) with permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) is investigated. A control scheme is developed that improves the frequency control performance, illustrating the importance of the initial active power output of the FCWTG. A method of carefully ending the frequency support of a wind farm is proposed and simulated. The resulting frequency control performance compares favorably to that of a conventional synchronous generator plant.},

abstract = {Based on the state-of-the-art in the relevant fields, the main objectives of the project are: a) To achieve self-organized TiO 2 nanotubes (NTs) with a similar degree of order as with porous Al 2 O 3 and Si. This part of the work is mainly carried out at the coordinators' laboratory and is performed constantly over the duration of the project. It has been possible to generate porosity in many different valve metals so far [1-7] which is a very promising precondition for this part of the project. The very interesting results in this area have shown that there is a broad range of systems that can be treated to generate porous structures and that, depending on the conditions of anodizing, various pore dimensions, orientations, conformations and morphologies can be obtained. A further important aspect is the influence of annealing procedures, which is investigated in parallel. Overall, there will be more significant effort put into the art of creating new porous structures under different conditions. b) The properties of all the different systems achieved in (a) are investigated with surface analytical techniques, in particular SEM, XPS, AES, RBS, NRA, MEIS and ToF-SIMS. c) The key mechanisms leading to self-ordering (field effects, chemical effects, stress induced effects, etc.) have to be identified and investigated in order to understand better the driving forces for pore development, continued growth, and self-ordering. The investigations related to this milestone are performed at UM and at FAU, particularly with TEM and the surface analytical techniques mentioned in (b) and later work packages. These detailed studies are carried out on every new system that shows tube growth under certain conditions. This objective is therefore relevant to every system investigated and is an important part of the project throughout its overall duration. d) The possibility to exploit the self-organized TiO 2 nanotubes, with focus on solar-energy conversion (dye-sensitized solar cell), is addressed. The effect of doping and dye sensitization will be investigated in detail. The properties of self-organized TiO 2 nanotube layers and their performance, compared with currently used nanostructured systems produced by TiO 2 nanoparticle sintering, is determined in this step. The research related to this milestone is mainly carried out in Greece by Dr. P. Falaras's group at the NCSRD as they have the highest state of knowledge in this area. Nonetheless, researchers will be exchanged between the institutes in order to guarantee the exchange of knowledge and ideas. NCSRD provides the synthesis of new sensitizers presenting broad and intense metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption bands in the visible like Ru(II) complexes of bipyridine (bipy), terpyridine (terpy), phenanthroline and related ligands bearing carboxylic or phosphonic acid functional groups and their efficient incorporation (and optimisation) in dye-sensitised photoelectrochemical solar cells, having a solid-state structure and using polymer based redox NMP Priority 3 Specific Targeted Research Projects Ti-Nanotubes Project No: 033313, Final Activity Report-Full Duration 2 electrolytes. Surface chemical modification of the Ti-Nanotubes by noble metal deposition and N, S, P doping is performed for direct application in photocatalytic processes, including fabrication, modeling, and evaluation of photocatalytic reactors for efficient photodegradation of water (azo-dyes) and air pollutants (volatile organic compounds, VOCs). Eventually, superhydrophylic surfaces with self-cleaning and anti-fogging properties will be developed. This objective is split into two main parts: first, fundamental research on the newly developed systems from objectives a), b) and c) and their comparison in terms of the photo-response and second, the development of new photo-active nanotube-systems (ideas are based on the results obtained with the already investigated nanotube arrays) which in turn will be produced at the FAU (a). The main innovative aspect is the application of new nanotube-structures that have been produced by anodizing under different experimental conditions. The investigation methods performed in (b) and (c) gave a clear insight into the mechanisms of pore generation and growth and the investigations and application in (d) revealed aspects that are important for the technological improvement of the produced nanotubes. The different systems have been classified in terms of their technological value and new ideas for improvement of the systems can be developed and optimized simultaneously.},

abstract = {This paper presents a detailed description of finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) applied to power converters. Several key aspects related to this methodology are, in depth, presented and compared with traditional power converter control techniques, such as linear controllers with pulsewidth-modulation-based methods. The basic concepts, operating principles, control diagrams, and results are used to provide a comparison between the different control strategies. The analysis is performed on a traditional three-phase voltage source inverter, used as a simple and comprehensive reference frame. However, additional topologies and power systems are addressed to highlight differences, potentialities, and challenges of FCS-MPC. Among the conclusions are the feasibility and great potential of FCS-MPC due to present-day signal-processing capabilities, particularly for power systems with a reduced number of switching states and more complex operating principles, such as matrix converters. In addition, the possibility to address different or additional control objectives easily in a single cost function enables a simple, flexible, and improved performance controller for power-conversion systems.},

abstract = {-This paper designed the gate driver circuits and optimized the PCB layout in a 7.2kW battery charger using paralleled GaN HEMTs. 650V/60A enhancement mode GaN HEMTs provided by GaN Systems Inc are adopted. To optimize the switching performance of paralleled GaN HEMTs with low loss and high reliability, effects of parasitic inductance and capacitance are modeled and analyzed. Through cancelling the flux in the commutation loop, the power-loop parasitic inductance is reduced to only 0.7nH, which significantly decreases the electrical stress in the switch turn-off process. A diverse-parameter gate driver design has been proposed to achieve the reliable switching off. The Finite-Element-Analysis and Spice simulation show our current design could effectively suppress the voltage overshoot and gate-drive ringing on HEMTs. Experiments were carried out on both double pulse test platform and the 7.2kW charger to verify the proposed design strategy.},

abstract = {—Fault diagnosis of the bearings in direct-drive (i.e., no gearbox) wind turbines is a challenging issue due to the varying shaft rotating frequency (SRF) caused by the erratic wind environ-ment. To remove the spectrum smearing phenomena of the SRF-related components and the disturbances of the SRF-unrelated components in a measured signal, this paper proposes a novel method, called multiscale filtering spectrum (MFS), to obtain the weighted energy distribution of the monocomponent signals within a local order range based on the Vold-Kalman filter (VKF). First, the instantaneous SRF of the wind turbine is estimated from a gen-erator current signal. Then, a VKF-based multiscale filter bank is designed according to the center frequencies corresponding to the SRF at different scales. The monocomponent signals whose fre-quencies are continuous multipliers of the SRF are subsequently extracted from the envelope of the measured current or vibration signal. Finally, a weighted energy spectrum is constructed within the selected order range, from which possible bearing fault charac-teristic orders can be identified. Simulation and experiment results show that the proposed new MFS method can enhance the char-acteristic orders and suppress the noise, and therefore has better performance than the traditional angular resampling method for bearing fault diagnosis of direct-drive wind turbines under varying speed conditions. Index Terms—Bearing, current signal, fault diagnosis, multi-scale filtering spectrum (MFS), vibration signal, vold-kalman filter (VKF), wind turbine.},

We use a finite-element code to model the transient dynamics of a typical electromagnetic launcher guide rail. We found that dynamic rail deflections caused by the movement of the armature are similar in magnitude to those caused by the magnetic field, and that the contact pressure between the armature and the rails changes dramatically when the speed of the armature reaches the critical velocity of the rails.},

The characteristics and hence MPP point changes with the variation in insolation and temperature. In order to extract a maximum power from PV array, a fuzzy based MPP tracking algorithm is proposed. The algorithm accepts single input that is slope of P-V curve and generates the duty ratio as an output that operates the boost converter to track MPP. The algorithm gives faster convergence by applying variable step in duty ratio and gives accurate MPP. The two stage grid interactive PV system described in this paper supplies active power as well as provides harmonic and reactive power compensation. This additional feature increases the effective utilization of PV inverter and increases the overall efficiency of the system. The simulation results validate the performance and stability of the grid interactive PV system using the proposed algorithm for active current injection as well as harmonics and reactive power compensation. � 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {A method for controlling an active power filter using neural networks is presented. Currently, there is an increase of voltage and current harmonics in power systems, caused by nonlinear loads. The active power filters (APFs) are used to compensate the generated harmonics and to correct the load power factor. The proposed control design is a pulse width modulation control (PWM) with two blocks that include neural networks. Adaptive networks estimate the reference compensation currents. On the other hand, a multilayer perceptron feedforward network (trained by a backpropagation algorithm) that works as a hysteresis band comparator is used. Two practical cases with Matlab-Simulink are presented to check the proposed control performance.},

GaN performance at elevated temperature is especially unique. Turn-on time increases significantly with temperature, and turn-on losses increase as a result. This phenomenon can be explained based on the relationships between junction temperature and GaN device transconductance, and between transconductance and turn-on time. An analytical relationship between temperature and turn-on loss has been derived for the 650-V GS66508 from GaN Systems, and verified with experimental results. Based on this relationship, a detailed model is developed, and a simplified scaling factor is proposed for estimating turn-on loss in e-mode GaN HFETs, using room-temperature switching characterization and typically published datasheet parameters.},

In order to reduce the initial ablation of the rail, we designed magnetic field coils outside the beginning part of the rails of our railgun. The coils enhance the initial magnetic field and increase the uniformity of the current distribution in the rails.

abstract = {In electrical islands, frequency excursions are sizeable and automatic load shedding is often required in response to disturbances. Moreover, the displacement of conventional generation with wind and solar plants, which usually do not provide inertial response, further weakens these power systems. Fast-acting storage, by injecting power within instants after the loss of a generating unit, can back up conventional generation assets during the activation of their primary reserve. This paper relies on dynamic simulations to study the provision of such a dynamic frequency control support by energy storage systems in the French island of Guadeloupe with large shares of wind or solar generation. The results show that fast-acting storage, by acting as a synthetic inertia, can mitigate the impact of these sources on the dynamic performance of the studied island grid in the case of a major generation outage. The other concerns raised by renewables (e.g., variability, forecast accuracy, low voltage ride-through, etc.) have not been addressed within this project.},

abstract = {A concept of an integrated and distributed inverter for switched reluctance machines is introduced. The application at hand is an outer-rotor direct drive designed for railway traction applications. A five-phase switched reluctance machine was developed and is used to demonstrate the function of the integrated and distributed inverter. The distribution is achieved by supplying each phase coil with its own modular inverter. Each inverter module is placed evenly around the end of the stator stack next to its dedicated coil. This increases the redundancy of the drive significantly. The likelihood of phase-to-phase faults is reduced, because no overlapping end-turns are necessary. Also, the integration of machine and inverter is simplified, because the semiconductors can be evenly distributed around the machine. The concept reduces the amount of terminals between drive and vehicle to communication, power supply, and cooling, independent of the number of machine phases. With the integrated and distributed inverter new control strategies can be developed to influence machine vibration and radiated noise. In this paper, the design of the prototype, the direct torque control of the five-phase machine, and the behavior in the case of a fault inside a module is analyzed.},

These drawbacks can be highly eliminated by designing systems without using any kind of sensors. In this paper, sensorless speed control of a dc motor was performed by using extended Kalman filter (EKF) and particle filter (PF). The speed information is estimated by using armature current data measured from a dc motor which is controlled in various speed references with a closed-loop controller. Furthermore, a performance comparison of the EKF and the PF by taking into consideration their estimation errors under the same conditions was realized in a simulation environment. The comparison results showed that the estimation performance of the PF is more accurate but slower than the EKF. The quantitative values of accurateness and slowness are depended on the particle number of the PF. The obtained computation times of the PF having ten particles and the EKF are 180 and 15 $\mu$s, respectively.},

In the first section of this paper, after definition of problem and electromagnetic equations, effect of variation of rails dimension and distance between rails on inductance gradient, self inductance and mutual inductance for circular and rectangular rails are explored. In the second part, a new method for increasing of inductance gradient in simple railgun and augmented railgun is suggested. This method uses technique that decrease reluctance of flux path and make a noticeable increase in gradient inductance.},

abstract = {Inductance gradient of railgun is one of the most important parameters to railgun launch efficiency. The inductance gradient of simple railgun without metal container (tube) can be calculated via Kerrisk's approximate formula when the structure of rails is fixed. However, the metal container would be necessary if the repulsion on the rails is great enough in mega Ampere current railgun. Then eddy current will be induced in metal container because of the variable magnetic flux density. In this paper, the effects eddy current putting on the inductance gradient of railgun are investigated with Maxwell 3D modular of Ansoft Corp.. Models of railgun with metal-insulated combination containment (laminated containment) are simulated and compared with solid metal containment railgun and air containment railgun. The eddy current density and Lorentz force put on amature of each model are calculated. It is found that the inductance gradient fluctuates with the armature position relative to containment and the fluctuating amplitude decreases with the electrical conductivity. The reduction of inductance gradient is very little when the metal segments of containment are not wider than caliber. It's notable that the inductance gradient decreases rapidly near muzzle.},

abstract = {C-GEN is a new topology of direct-drive permanent magnet generator being developed at University of Edinburgh. The main benefits are reduced overall system mass and ease of manufacturing, due to the use of an air-cored winding, but with a modular PM rotor consisting of C-core modules. A 15kW rotary prototype has been fitted and tested on a commercially available wind turbine. Initial sizing studies for wind indicate that the C-GEN concept will be up to 50{\%} lighter than conventional iron cored PM direct drive generators [10]. In addition to wind the C-GEN has applications in marine energy converters. The authors are working with four marine developers to investigate the feasibility of C-GEN for their technology. The results from two of those studies will be presented in this paper namely; Aquamarine Oyster device – near shore wave energy converter, Scotrenewables SRTT device – tidal current energy converter. In order to find the most optimum solution for the specific application; electromagnetic, thermal, structural and economical design aspects of the generator are defined and coupled using an analytical design tool. To evaluate different design variations an optimization tool is developed based on genetic algorithm. All these considerations make the optimised generator design a very close optimum solution for the “real-world”.},

The paper proposes an accurate and meaningful approach to the faulty stator leakage inductance and describes a nonlinear phenomenon in the faulty circuit. The asymmetric model is developed in detail and represented in state-space (SS) form with the flux-linkages as the SS variable. Based on the proposed model, steady-state complex-vector, operational, and sequence component equivalent circuits are derived for fault detection and identification purposes. For reasons of verification, the model is simulated in MatLab environment and experimen-tally corroborated for a 1HP three-phase squirrel-cage IM. The simulations and experiments are compared at no-load and loading condition for both transient and steady-state response. The per-manent regime analysis studies the model with respect to the fault severity factor, fault resistance, and load variation. The proposed model shows high correlation with the experimental results.

abstract = {Industrial applications of medium-voltage drives impose increasingly stringent performance requirements, particularly with regard to harmonic distortions of the phase currents of the controlled electrical machine. An established method to achieve very low current distortions during steady-state operation is to employ offline calculated optimized pulse patterns (OPP). Achieving high dynamic performance, however, proves to be very difficult in a system operated by OPPs. In this paper, we propose a method that combines the optimal steady-state performance of OPPs with the very fast dynamics of trajectory tracking control. A constrained optimal control problem with a receding horizon policy, i.e., model predictive control (MPC), is formulated and solved. Results show that the combination of MPC with OPPs satisfies both the strict steady-state as well as the dynamic performance requirements imposed by the most demanding industrial applications. The estimation of the fundamental components of the machine variables separately from their respective harmonic components is not required. As a result, complicated structures such as observers can be avoided, contrary to state-of-the-art methods. A further advantage of the MPC method is the use of a receding horizon policy, which provides feedback and a high degree of robustness.},

abstract = {The authors identify and characterize a velocity and efficiency limiting effect called contact velocity skin effect (VSEC) which occurs in the interface of a railgun's sliding contact. Despite enormous contact forces, the armature will remain separated from the rail by a thin adsorbed layer, on the order of 10 to 15 angstroms in this investigation. Electrical conduction through the layer is via quantum tunneling which is more resistive than classical conduction through the conductor. A comprehensive theory to account VSEC is presented and is applicable to all constant gradient electromagnetic launchers. The theory not only accounts for the velocity-limit effect, but also predicts a maximum efficiency. Theoretical parameters include the inductance gradient, system resistance, projectile velocity, and sliding contact area. Theoretical predictions are compared to experimental data from a conventional and an augmented railgun. The augmented railgun is a 3-turn augmented system with 40 mm bore x 750 mm length typically operating at 250 kA peak current with a projectile velocity of 300 m/s. The conventional railgun is 40 mm bore x 4000 mm length which typically operates at 850 kA with a projectile velocity of 1600 m/s. The characterization of VSEC predicts velocity saturation and efficiency roll-off in electromagnetic launchers and provides new insights into EML operation and physics especially with regard to the armature and its contacts.},

abstract = {This thesis deals with thermal management aspects of electric machinery used in high-performance applications with particular focus put on electric machines designed for hybrid electric vehicle applications. In the first part of this thesis, new thermal models of liquid (water and oil) cooled electric machines are proposed. The proposed thermal models are based on a combination of lumped parameter (LP) and numerical methods. As a first case study, a permanent-magnet assisted synchronous reluctance machine (PMaSRM) equipped with a housing water jacket is considered. Particular focus is put on the stator winding and a thermal model is proposed that divides the stator slot into a number of elliptical copper and impregna- tion layers. Additionally, an analysis, using results from a proposed simplified thermal finite element (FE) model representing only a single slot of the sta- tor and its corresponding end winding, is presented in which the number of layers and the proper connection between the parts of the LP thermal model representing the end winding and the active part of winding are determined. The approach is attractive due to its simplicity and the fact that it closely models the actual temperature distribution for common slot geometries. An oil-cooled induction machine where the oil is in direct contact with the stator laminations is also considered. Here, a multi-segment structure is proposed that divides the stator, winding and cooling system into a number of an- gular segments. Thereby, the circumferential temperature variation due to the nonuniform distribution of the coolant in the cooling channels can be predicted. In the second part of this thesis, the thermal impact of using different winding impregnation and steel lamination materials is studied. Conven- tional varnish, epoxy and a silicone based thermally conductive impregnation material are investigated and the resulting temperature distributions in three small induction machines are compared. The thermal impact of using different steel lamination materials is investigated by simulations using the developed thermal model of the water cooled PMaSRM. The differences in alloy con- tents and steel lamination thickness are studied separately and a comparison between the produced iron losses and the resulting hot-spot temperatures is presented. Finally, FE-based approaches for estimating the induced magnet eddycurrent losses in the rotor of the considered PMaSRM are reviewed and compared in the form of a case study based on simulations. A simplified three-dimensional FE model and an analytical model, both combined with time-domain 2D FE analysis, are shown to predict the induced eddy current losses with a relatively good accuracy compared to a complete 3D FE based model. Hence, the two simplified approaches are promising which motivates a possible future experimental verification.},

Models of equivalent series resistance that are valid over a range of frequency and operating temperature are derived and experimentally validated. The root-mean-square values and frequency spectra of the capacitor current are analyzed with respect to three modulation strategies and various operating conditions over practical ranges of load power factor and modulation index in EV drive systems. The modeling and analysis also consider the self-heating process and resulting core temperature of the dc-link capacitors, which impacts their lifetimes. Based on an 80-kW permanent-magnet (PM) motor drive system, the application of electrolytic capacitors and film capacitors has been evaluated by both simulation and experimental tests.

abstract = {—This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of per-manent magnet synchronous machine stator winding impedance variation in inter-turn short-circuit and eccentricity faults. The phase impedances are monitored through an extended self-commissioning procedure at the standstill mode before or after operation, and hence are agnostic to well-known issues caused by transients, load/speed level, or controller coefficient dependency. Moreover, the effect of stator iron core saturation on the electri-cal parameters is analyzed in depth. In order to distinguish the inter-turn shorts from the eccentricity fault which exhibits simi-lar behaviors, a classification algorithm based on the saturation effect is introduced and analyzed on the machines with different pole–slot combinations. Both two-dimensional finite element anal-ysis simulation and experimental test results are provided to show the efficacy of this analysis. Index Terms—Eccentricity fault, electrical parameter, inter-turn short-circuit fault, magnetic saturation, permanent magnet syn-chronous machines (PMSMs).},

An appropriate design and material choice of metallic projectiles, accelerated from the rest position, allow the current to be injected at the front side and to be distributed over the whole armature. It is shown that the contact between rails and projectile is maintained with a dominant metallic value and transitioning to plasma arcs has been seen only during short time intervals. Accurate voltage and current measurements allow evaluating of the ohmic losses and energy partition in the whole system. Measured values of rail resistance and inductance gradient are presented and compared to numerical simulations. The results of several shots are presented and compared to theoretical predictions, For a stored energy of 1.96 MJ, an overall efficiency of 21{\%} is obtained with a projectile mass of 437 g accelerated to a velocity of 1370 m/s},

In order to suppress resonance and guarantee good performance, many strategies (e.g. active damping (AD), harmonic resonant control, repetitive control and grid feedforward) have been proposed. However, the wide variation of grid impedance value challenges system stability in practical applications. The aforementioned methods need to be investigated. This study evaluates the applicability of each part of the overall control in a weak grid case with the use of a stability criterion. It has been demonstrated that the feedback-based AD control can work well in a wide range of grid conditions. However, the resonant and repetitive control methods meet constraints. The grid feedforward method brings in an extra positive feedback path, and consequently results in high harmonics or even instability. Finally, a recommendation for system design has been presented. Simulations and experiments have been provided to verify the analysis.},

In order to provide robustness, a discrete-time integral term is added to the dead-beat current prediction.

abstract = {This paper presents a generalize model of ohmic contacts and a unified approach for the accurate extraction of specific contact resistivity ( pc) for ohmic contacts from measured contact resistance using the cross bridge Kelvin resistor, the contact end resistor, and the tranmsission line tap resistor test structures. A general three-dimensional (3-D) model of the contacts has been developed from the first principles and has been reduced to 2-D, 1-D, and 0-D (one lump) models with the necessary approximations. It is shown that the conventional 1-D models overestimate the value of pc because of the parasitic resistance due to 2-D current flow around the periphery of the contact window. Using 2-D simulations, we have accurately modeled the current crowding effects and have extracted accurate values of pc independent of contact size and the test structure type. A theory of scaling of contacts has been developed and is applied to commonly used structures. A universal set of curves has been derived for each particular contact resistance test structure and, given the geometry of the structure, these allow accurate determination of pc without the actual use of the 2-D simulator. Experimental and theoretical accuracy of the three test structures has been compared. Accurate values of pc for various contact materials to n+ and p+ Si have been determined. The data confirm that in the past researchers have overestimated pc, and that pc will not limit device performance even with submicrometer design rules.},

abstract = {Cascaded multilevel converter structure can be appealing for high-power solar photovoltaic (PV) systems thanks to its modularity, scalability, and distributed maximum power point tracking (MPPT). However, the power mismatch from cascaded individual PV converter modules can bring in voltage and system operation issues. This paper addresses these issues, explores the effects of reactive power compensation and optimization on system reliability and power quality, and proposes coordinated active and reactive power distribution to mitigate this issue. A vector method is first developed to illustrate the principle of power distribution. Accordingly, the relationship between power and voltage is analyzed with a wide operation range. Then, an optimized reactive power compensation algorithm (RPCA) is proposed to improve the system operation stability and reliability, and facilitate MPPT implementation for each converter module simultaneously. Furthermore, a comprehensive control system with the RPCA is designed to achieve effective power distribution and dynamic voltage regulation. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed reactive power compensation approach in grid-interactive cascaded PV systems.},

abstract = {The overall efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) systems connected to the grid depends on the efficiency of direct current (DC) of the solar modules to alternate current (AC) inverter conversion. The requirements for inverter connection include: maximum power point, high efficiency, control power injected into the grid, high power factor and low total harmonic distortion of the currents injected into the grid. An approach to power factor control and reactive power regulation for PV systems connected to the grid using field programmable gate array (FPGA) is proposed. According to the grid demands; both the injected active and reactive powers are controlled. In this paper, a new digital control strategy for a single-phase inverter is carried out. This control strategy is based on the phase shift between the inverter output voltage and the grid voltage, and the digital sinusoidal pulse width modulation (DSPWM) patterns, in order to control the power factor for a wide range of the inverter output current and consequently the control and the regulation of the reactive power will be achieved. The advantage of the proposed control strategy is its implementation around simple digital circuits. In this work, a simulation study of this strategy has been realized using Matlab/Simulink and PSIM. In order to validate its performance, this control has been implemented in a FPGA. Experimental tests have been carried out demonstrating the viability of this control in order to control the power factor and the injected power into the grid. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper, a new predictive direct torque control (DTC) method is proposed, which improves the dynamic response of the conventional DTC in the transient state and yields the minimum torque and flux ripples in the steady state through an optimal voltage vector. At the steady state, the magnitude, phase, and time duration of the voltage vector are adjusted in a manner where the minimum torque and flux ripples are obtained; whereas in the transient state, the voltage vector parameters are adjusted in a manner where the fastest dynamic response is achieved. The space-vector modulation is used in synthesizing the selected voltage vector where a fixed switching frequency is achieved. In order to improve the control system efficiency, the principle of maximum torque per ampere is adopted in obtaining the commanding stator flux magnitude. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the steady-state and transient-state performances are tested in MATLAB software and in practice. The simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed method yields the minimum torque and flux ripples while improving the dynamic response of the conventional DTC. The comparative investigation with an existing predictive DTC method indicates that the proposed method has a better performance in both the steady state and transient state.},

The feature extraction and dimensionality re-duction are useful preprocessing steps to obtain high performance in condition monitoring schemes. To address this issue, this work presents a novel diagnosis methodology based on high-dimensional feature reduction applied to detect multiple faults in an induction motor linked to a kinematic chain. The proposed methodology in-volves a hybrid feature reduction that ensures a good processing of the acquired vibration signals. The method is performed se-quentially. First, signal decomposition is carried out by means of empirical mode decomposition. Second, statistical-time-based fea-tures are estimated from the resulting decompositions. Third, a feature optimization is performed to preserve the data variance by a genetic algorithm in conjunction with the principal component analysis. Fourth, a feature selection is done by means of Fisher score analysis. Fifth, a feature extraction is performed through linear discriminant analysis. And, finally, sixth, the different con-sidered faults are diagnosed by a Neural Network-based classifier. The performance and the effectiveness of the proposed diagnosis methodology is validated experimentally and compared with classi-cal feature reduction strategies, making the proposed methodology suitable for industry applications.

abstract = {The two best-known methods for calculating high-frequency winding loss in round-wire windings-the Dowell method and the Ferreira method-give significantly different results at high frequency. We apply 2-D finite-element method (FEM) simulations to evaluate the accuracy of each method for predicting proximity-effect losses. We find that both methods can have substantial errors, exceeding 60{\%}. The Ferreira method, which is based on the exact Bessel-function solution for the eddy current in an isolated conducting cylinder subjected to a time-varying magnetic field, is found to be most accurate for loosely packed windings, whereas the Dowell method, which approximates winding layers comprising multiple turns of round wire with a rectangular conducting sheet, is most accurate for closely-packed windings. To achieve higher accuracy than is possible with either method alone, we introduce a new formula, based on modifying the Dowell method. Parameters in the new formula are chosen based on fitting our FEM simulation data. By expressing the results in terms of normalized parameters, we construct a model that can be used to determine proximity-effect loss for any round-wire winding with error under 2{\%}.},

abstract = {In distributed energy production, permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSG) are often connected to the grid via frequency converters, such as voltage source line converters. The price of the converter may constitute a large part of the costs of a generating set. Some of the permanent magnet synchronous generators with converters and traditional separately excited synchronous generators could be replaced by direct-on-line (DOL) non-controlled PMSGs. Small directly networkconnected generators are likely to have large markets in the area of distributed electric energy generation. Typical prime movers could be windmills, watermills and internal combustion engines. DOL PMSGs could also be applied in island networks, such as ships and oil platforms. Also various back-up power generating systems could be carried out with DOL PMSGs. The benefits would be a lower price of the generating set and the robustness and easy use of the system. The performance of DOL PMSGs is analyzed. The electricity distribution companies have regulations that constrain the design of the generators being connected to the grid. The general guidelines and recommendations are applied in the analysis. By analyzing the results produced by the simulation model for the permanent magnet machine, the guidelines for efficient damper winding parameters for DOL PMSGs are presented. The simulation model is used to simulate grid connections and load transients. The damper winding parameters are calculated by the finite element method (FEM) and determined from experimental measurements. Three-dimensional finite element analysis (3D FEA) is carried out. The results from the simulation model and 3D FEA are compared with practical measurements from two prototype axial flux permanent magnet generators provided with damper windings. The dimensioning of the damper winding parameters is case specific. The damper winding should be dimensioned based on the moment of inertia of the generating set. It is shown that the damper winding has optimal values to reach synchronous operation in the shortest period of time after transient operation. With optimal dimensioning, interference on the grid is minimized.},

Electromagnetic field analysis of the candidate motors obtained from GA with various dimensions is subjected through FEA to obtain the motors' characteristics. Based on the GA and FEA results, a candidate motor design is introduced and subjected to FEA for reoptimization and finalization of the motor design.

This paper deals with the use of another type of high magnetic field sensor based on thin ({\&}lt;1 mum) manganite films, which exhibit the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) effect. This sensor measures the magnitude of the magnetic induction and can have very small sensitive areas (e.g., 0.5 mmtimes50 mum). Some basics about CMR and the design of the sensor are given. Several sensors were used in experiments performed with the ISL-launcher EMA3 (E{\textless}sub{\textgreater}prim {\textless}/sub{\textgreater}=0.6 MJ, l=3 m, cal=15 mmtimes30 mm). Transient magnetic field profiles with rise times of approximately 50 mus and amplitudes up to 4 T were recorded. The results obtained with the CMR sensors are compared with those of conventional loop sensors. Also, some metrological peculiarities due to high-frequency coupling to the detector circuit are mentioned. The highly local measurements of these CMR sensors were validated by results obtained from 3-D finite element (FE) calculations of the magnetic field distributions},

PI and P+Resonat controllers are considered. For the P+Resonant controller different digital implementations are evaluated: shift operator based and delta operator based.

Problem-based learning (PBL), as a student-centered instructional approach, has contributed to important developments in engineering education over the last few years. This paper presents the experience of a problem-based learning approach within the context of teaching wind energy conversion systems for electricity generation at an Electrical and Electronic Master's degree level. Students were given the problem of finding the response of a wind turbine to a grid fault. Groups of three students worked on a cooperative learning project for 15 weeks, with the instructor providing resource assistance and information at all stages of the work. Two tools were designed to help the students: a virtual wind turbine simulator and a real wind turbine setup. Both experimental tools are described, and the results obtained by the students are discussed. The results show that the students valued both tools and were able to address problems at a high cognitive level.},

@article{Musgrove1983,
abstract = {The global wind-energy resource is very large and widely distributed; and, within Europe, wind energy has the potential to provide an energy output equal to about three times the present electricity consumption. Although the wind is not very reliable as a source of power from day to day, it is a reliable source of energy year by year, and the main role for future wind-energy systems will be operating in parallel with electricity grid systems or, in remote locations, in parallel with diesel engines, so saving fuel. Systems integration studies indicate that existing utility grid systems could accept a contribution of about 20{\%} from wind turbines, although, with changes to the future plant mix, the potential contribution is substantially greater: and similar percentage fuel savings are possible in remote locations with wind/diesel systems. Recent progress in the development of wind turbines is reviewed and the cost data now becoming available indicates that medium-sized machines, i.e. ? 20?40 m diameter and with power ratings in the range 50?500 kW, offer the most attractive economics for land-based applications in the near future, giving energy costs in the range 2.8?5.6 p/kWh, for a typical site where the annual average wind speed is 5.5 m/s (measured at the normal 10 m height); in windier locations energy costs will be lower. Corresponding capital costs for installed wind turbines are in the range 锟?50?1500/kW (with average outputs equal to about 30{\%} of the rated). The UK, in common with some other countries, has a large offshore wind-energy potential, but, to be economically competitive, offshore systems will need to use multimegawatt wind turbines with diameters of 100 m and larger. Prototype machines in this size range already exist, but considerable further development is needed before the construction of large offshore wind turbine arrays can commence, although this is a realistic prospect for the 1990s. The economics of wind-energy conversion systems are alr- eady encouraging, and commercial applications already in evidence, most notably in the USA and Denmark where more than 2000 wind turbines with a total installed capacity in excess of 150 MW have been installed in the past two years. However, further operational experience is required to demonstrate that reliable operation can be sustained over periods of many years. As this experience is accumulated, and as the cost benefits associated with quantity production are achieved, the market for wind turbines can be expected to expand rapidly.},

abstract = { Arcing transition of metal-to-metal contacts is a key technical challenge in the development of railgun launchers.  Theoretical understanding of the process remains poor and controversial. Several authors have explained transitioning by a velocity skin effect driven "melt wave" Others have shown experimentally, that arcing transition even occurs for static contacts subject to high current pulses, and have proposed a "contact resistance" model, with the contact resistance due to A-spots. This model explained the available experimental data reasonably well for armatures with relatively short lengths of the contact zone. The velocity skin effect model assumes a perfect, resistance free contact, while the contact resistance model neglects any velocity related effects. In this paper we combine the two approaches to obtain a more realistic picture of the velocity skin effect and its role in transitioning of armature contacts. We show that when realistic properties of the contact interface are taken into account, the structure of the velocity skin effect and the speed of a wave of local transitioning may significantly differ from the "ideal" theory.},

abstract = {As the development and installation of photovoltaic (PV) systems are still growing at an exceptionally rapid pace, relevant grid integration policies are going to change consequently in order to accept more PV systems in the grid. The next generation PV systems will play an even more active role like what the conventional power plants do today in the grid regulation participation. Requirements of ancillary services like Low-Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) associated with reactive current injection and voltage support through reactive power control, have been in effectiveness in some countries. Those advanced features can be provided by next-generation PV systems, and will be enhanced in the future to ensure an even efficient and reliable utilization of PV systems. In the light of this, Reactive Power Injection (RPI) strategies for single-phase PV systems are explored in this paper. The RPI possibilities are: a) constant average active power control, b) constant active current control, c) constant peak current control and d) thermal optimized control strategy. All those strategies comply with the currently active grid codes, but are with different objectives. The thermal optimized control strategy is demonstrated on a 3 kW single-phase PV system by simulations. The other three RPI strategies are verified experimentally on a 1 kW singe-phase system in LVRT operation mode. Those results show the effectiveness and feasibilities of the proposed strategies with reactive power control during LVRT operation. The design and implementation considerations for the characterized strategies are also discussed.},

This paper presents a system level design tool that optimises the power density (volume or mass) of a 3-phase, 2-level DC-AC converter. The design tool optimises the selection of the devices, heatsink and passive components (including the design of the line, EMI and DC-link filters) to maximise the power density. The structure of the optimisation algorithm has been organised to reduce the number of potential design combinations by over 99{\%}, and thus produces fast simulation times. The design tool predicts that when SiC devices are used instead of Si ones, the power density is increased by 159.4{\%}. A 5 kW, 600 V DC-link, 3-phase, 2- level DC-AC converter was experimentally evaluated in order to confirm the accuracy of the design tool.},

abstract = {Gallium nitride high electron mobility transistors (GaN HEMTs) are promising switching devices in high-efficiency and high-density dc-dc converters due to their fast switching speed and small conduction resistance. However, GaN HEMTs are very sensitive to parasitic inductance because of their high switching speed, low-threshold voltage, and small driving safety margin. Parasitic inductance can cause severe voltage overshoot and ringing, whichmay result in electromagnetic interference issues, false turnon, or even device breakdown. This paper aims at reducing the parasitic inductance (including power loop inductance and driver loop inductance) by optimizing the layout. First, a multiloop method is proposed to reduce the parasitic inductance. Optimization of both the conventional single-loop structure and the proposed multiloop structure are presented. Second, three kinds of power loop layouts based on the proposed multiloop structure are realized on PCB substrate and one of them is realized on aluminum nitride (AlN) substrate, which has higher thermal conductivity but less copper layers. The power loop inductance on PCB substrate is reduced to 0.1 nH, which is only 25{\%} of the state-of-art layout. The power loop inductance on AlN substrate is reduced to 0.22 nH. Third, the driver loop layout is optimized and achieves 50{\%} reduction of driver loop inductance compared with the conventional single-layer layout. Finally, integrated modules using the proposed layouts are built to validate the analyses and designs.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system that is consisted of a boost converter with maximum power tracking, battery charge controller, inverter, and the related control circuits. A sliding mode controller is designed for controlling the boost converter to output the maximum power of the solar cells. A control strategy is proposed of a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) impendence adapter coupling a photovoltaic generator to a battery. The proposed strategy is based on the sliding mode control theory of continuing systems to permit a direct control of power converter. The PV generator price is even relatively high, so the user is interested of the optimal coupling of PV generator to electromechanical loads. In fact, this system uses the optimal coupling in order to have maximum power during the whole operating period. A grid-connected inverter is designed to transform the maximum output power into the load and utility. The real power control is using zero-cross and phase-lock circuits that control the inverter output voltage which is phase lead and synchronized with the utility. A digital circuit is used to detect the phase angles of the load voltage and current to control the inverter output amplitude to achieve the reactive power load compensation. A monitor circuit is designed to detect the voltage and frequency variation in the utility. When the photovoltaic system encounters a voltage and frequency deviation, the monitor circuit immediately disconnects the photovoltaic system from the utility to prevent the island effect. The proposed system is implemented by using OP amplifiers and micro controller (PIC16F877A). Both the simulation and experimental results using MATLAB show the sliding mode controller for maximum power tracking has good performance. The phase and amplitude control experiments achieve the real and reactive power control. The island effect experiments demonstrate evidence of the solar cell system protection ability illustrating the proposed grid-connected photovoltaic system has good operating performance.},

We focus on buildings equipped with a water tank used for actively storing cold water produced by a series of chillers. Typically the chillers are operated each night to recharge the storage tank in order to meet the buildings demand on the following day. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) for the chillers operation is designed in order to optimally store the thermal energy in the tank by using predictive knowledge of building loads and weather conditions. This paper addresses real-time implementation and feasibility issues of the MPC scheme by using a (1) simplified hybrid model of the system, (2) periodic robust invariant sets as terminal constraints and (3) a moving window blocking strategy.},

The primary goal of these experiments was to launch a dual-armature launch package in the two-turn configuration while maintaining electrical isolation between the rail and armature pairs. Two tests with the dual-armature launch package on a single-turn configuration independently examined the performance of the launch package. Results of those tests showed good thermal and structural performance of the armature assembly and no melt transfer between the armature contact regions. Five tests were then conducted on the two-turn rail configuration. During the second test, the crossover that connects the two rail pairs at the breech suffered arcing damage at the rail contacts. A new crossover was fabricated, and all subsequent tests were successful with no crossover arcing. The final system had a propulsive inductance gradient of 1.8 muH/m, with projectiles successfully launched in excess of 400 m/s at linear current densities up to 35 kA/mm.},

abstract = {Electrical conduction through anisotropically conductive adhesive (ACA) is caused by deformation of metal fillers under pressure and heat. In this work, the hardness of the electrical particles under various deformation degrees was determined by nano-indentor measurements and the electrical resistance of the electrical contacts was measured under various deformation degrees. Theoretical model and simulation have been developed for the microscopic mechanism of the electrical conduction through metal fillers in the anisotropically conductive adhesive. By comparing with experimental data it is concluded that the deformation of the metal filler in our ACA is plastic even at rather low external load. Further theoretical simulation reveals two important aspects of the conductance characteristics. The conductance is improved by increasing the external load but the dependence of the conductance on the spatial position of the metal filler becomes stronger. Design and optimization of the ACA with respect to the absolute value of the electric conductance and its dependence on the spatial position of the metal filler are of essential importance for the electronics packaging application of the anisotropically conductive adhesives.

The main significance of the generator topology is that the relative position of the magnets, copper and steel has been chosen so that there are no magnetic attraction forces between the stator and permanent magnet translator. The magnetic force between magnets is reacted within a self supporting structure. The lack of magnetic forces and the modular nature of the generator topology makes the manufacture and assembly of the generator easier than a conventional iron-cored permanent magnet generator. Modeling techniques used to design the generator topology are described and photos are presented to demonstrate the benefits of the topology in terms of manufacture and assembly.},

The goal of the control is to have the BESS to provide as much smoothing as possible, so that the wind farm can be dispatched on an hourly basis based on the forecasted wind conditions. The effectiveness of this control strategy has been tested by using an actual wind farm data. Furthermore, a real-time implementation strategy using model predictive control is also proposed. Finally, it is shown that the control strategy is very important in improving the BESS performance for this application.},

abstract = {The Current Controlled Voltage Source Inverter (CCVSI) has attracted substantial research due to its common application for the integration of renewable energy resources into the main grid. The single loop current controller is commonly used in industry for CCVSI due to its simplicity, desirable stability margins and dynamic performance. For the single loop controller, the point of common coupling (PCC) voltage feedforward control is used to improve the transient and disturbance rejection performance. However, this solution exhibits one drawback that has not yet been adequately discussed in the literature: the poor stability caused by the feedforward control itself. It is proved that the feedforward voltage results in a “positive feedback control” which essentially degrades the stability of the system and its control performance. Since the gain of the “positive feedback control” depends on the grid impedance, it is necessary to study how the stability and control performance of the grid parallel inverter is affected by the feedforward control under various grid impedances. The system without feedforward control is also investigated due the fact that the grid impedance generally affects the system stability. The analytical study shows that two cases have similar performance under stiff grid, while the case without feedforward has superior stability and control performance under weak grid impedance. The simulation and experimental results also validate the outcome of the analytical study.},

It aims at presenting more accurate calculations based on a combination of methods that take into account lifetime operation of wind turbines. Such calculations are not available for megawatt (MW) level turbines. The proposed method is used to evaluate typical permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) available in the technical literature. The new method's outcome is compared to conventional methods used to calculate energy yield per cost.

abstract = {This paper investigates differences of parasitic inductances caused by DC bus bar patterns on printed circuit boards(PCB). The DC bus bar pattern on the PCB is limited depending on the layout of main circuits and the control circuits. Two patterns which are a laminated wiring pattern and a plane wiring pattern are compared in experiments and simulations. In this paper, it will be clarified that effects of the DC bus bars on PCBs such as a surge voltage of a switch in terms of the parasitic inductance depending on the circuits on PCBs. As a result, if the same parasitic inductance which is 20 nH, is realized between each wiring pattern at the same length, the plane wiring pattern requires over ten times of the pattern width compared with that of the laminated wiring pattern. Hence, the circuit size can be downsized when the laminated pattern is used. From the experimental results, the maximum surge voltage in the plane wiring pattern is larger than that in the laminated wiring pattern. In this case, the parasitic inductance value of the plane wiring pattern is three times that of the laminated wiring pattern. However, the surge voltage in the laminated pattern is reduced by 7{\%} compared with the plane wiring pattern. As a consequence, the ratio of the surge voltage does not match that of the parasitic inductance. As a result, not only the parasitic inductance of the DC bus bar but also it is necessary to consider other parasitic inductances on PCBs such as parasitic inductances into input capacitors and the path between an upper MOSFET and a lower one and so on.},

As wind plants (WP) installations are at an emergent pace, they must also contribute to maintain stability and reliability of the power system. However, the rotating mass of variable-speed wind turbines is decoupled from the grid frequency. Thus, it does not inherently exhibit an inertial frequency response (IFR) unless controlled for that specific purpose.

abstract = {—This paper investigates a new fault detection method for induction machines diagnosis. The proposed detection method is based on hypothesis testing. The decision is made between two hypotheses: the machine is healthy and the machine is faulty. The generalized likelihood ratio test is used to address this issue with un-known signal and noise parameters. To implement this detector, the unknown parameters are replaced by their estimates. Specifically, four estimations are required, which are model order, frequency, phase, and amplitude estimations. The model order is obtained using the Bayesian information criterion. Total least-squares esti-mation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques is used to estimate frequencies. Then, phases and amplitudes are obtained using the least-squares estimator. The proposed approach performance is assessed using simulation data by plotting the re-ceiver operating characteristic curves. Two faults are considered: bearing and broken rotor bar faults. Experimental tests clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed detector.

abstract = {Mutual inductance is a phenomenon caused by the circulation of the magnetic flux in the core of an electrical machine. It is the result of the effect of the current flowing in one phase on the other phases. In conventional three-phase machines, such an effect has no influence on the electrical behaviour of the device. Although these machines are powered by power inverters, no problem should occur. The result is not the same for multi-star machines. If these machines are using a conventional winding structure, namely distributed windings, and are powered by voltage source converters, current ripples appear in the power supply lines. These current ripples are related to magnetic couplings between the stars. Designers should check these current ripples in order to stay within the limits imposed by the specifications. These electric current disturbances also provide torque ripples. With concentrated windings, a new degree of freedom appears; the configuration—number of slots/number of poles—can have a positive impact. The circulation of the magnetic flux is the initial phenomenon that produces the mutual inductance. The main goal of this discussion is to describe a design method that is able to produce not only a machine with low mutual inductance between phases, but also a multi-star machine where the stars and the phases are magnetically decoupled or less coupled. This discussion only takes into $\backslash$r$\backslash$naccount the machines that use permanent magnets mounted on the rotor surface. This $\backslash$r$\backslash$narticle is part of a study aimed at designing a high efficiency generator using fractional-slot $\backslash$r$\backslash$nconcentrated-windings (FSCW).},

abstract = {Globally, buildings are responsible for 40{\%} of the total world annual energy consumption which is responsible for one-third of green house gas emissions around the world. A significant portion of this energy is used for lighting, heating, cooling, and air conditioning purposes in buildings. Increasing awareness of the environmental impact of green house gas emissions and CFCs triggered a renewed interest in environmentally friendly cooling, and heating technologies for buildings. Free cooling of buildings may be seen as an alternate to compressor based air conditioning systems used for the buildings. In free cooling, nighttime cold is accumulated in storage material and extracted when needed. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs) can be used for free-cooling purposes due to their high storage density. In free cooling, using PCM as storage material, cool air during night is used to solidify the PCM and the accumulated cold is extracted during the hot day times. In this article a detailed review of work conducted by different researchers on PCM based free cooling is presented. Major challenges being faced in the design of PCM based free cooling system such as phase change materials; their thermo-physical properties and the geometry of encapsulation are elaborated and discussed in detail. Also the parameters effecting the charging and discharging of PCM, effect of phase change temperature and climatic conditions on thermal performance of the free cooling system are also discussed. Potential reduction in CO2 emissions due to the applicability of free cooling systems in residential and commercial buildings is also discussed in this article. This paper also provides a comprehensive list of the PCMs currently being used and that can be used potentially for free cooling applications. At last, this paper also presents some current problems needed further research in this area. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The common-mode (CM) voltage produced by a PWM inverter also has fast transitions that result in high peak currents to ground. For low-power ac drives, this can present several issues, such as pump-up of the dc bus and failure of the power module due to high instantaneous currents that are often undetected because of the typical sampling algorithm used. In this paper, existing drive output filter solutions are reviewed, and a new filter design is presented, which has integrated DM and CM impedance with damping matched to typical cable surge impedance. This eliminates reflections of both DM and CM traveling waves and also reduces peak cable charging currents. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate that the new filter has improved performance to reduce motor DM and CM voltages and drive output CM current, thus mitigating the issues specifically seen with low-power ac drives. Complete design details for the filter and a particular implementation of the integrated DM and CM reactor are also presented.},

abstract = {This paper outlines the design procedure for a permanent-magnet (PM) wind generator, which is optimized for energy capture over a wide operating range (i.e. a range of speeds and loads). This is achieved by using an optimisation routine to find the permutation of generator design variables, which maximises its energy capture when operated through the normal operating regions of a variable speed wind turbine. In so doing, the efficiency vs. speed curve of the generator is shaped to produce a high average efficiency over the operating range of the turbine. This is in direct contrast to conventional machine design methods of producing a high absolute efficiency at a single operating point (i.e. rated speed and load)},

abstract = {This paper investigates the feedforward schemes of grid voltages for a three-phase LCL-type grid-connected inverter. The full-feedforward functions of grid voltages are derived for the stationary $\alpha$- $\beta$ frame, synchronous d - q frame, and decoupled synchronous d - q frame-controlled three-phase LCL-type grid-connected inverters. The derived full-feedforward functions mainly consist of three parts which are proportional, derivative, and second derivative parts. The use of the traditional proportional feedforward function in the three-phase LCL -type grid-connected inverter will result in the amplification of the high-frequency injected grid current harmonics. With the proposed full-feedforward schemes, the injected grid current harmonics and unbalance caused by grid voltages can be greatly reduced. The effectiveness of the proposed feedforward schemes is verified by the experimental results.},

The novelty lies in combining a motor analysis procedure with a genetic algorithm to optimise an objective function such as the motor torque, the efficiency, the material cost or some other motor figures or a combination of these. Two approaches to the motor analysis are presented: the first is based on a fully analytical procedure; while the second utilises the finite element method. Some optimised design examples, with reference to surface-mounted permanent-magnet three-phase motors, are included, and a comparison between the genetic algorithm optimisation technique and the classical hill-climbing direct-search method is made. A discussion on the limitations and benefits of the proposed design approach concludes the paper},

abstract = {Increasing power system flexibility by responsive demand is a central issue for the incorporation of higher levels of variable wind generation in future power systems. The electrification of the heat sector, except from energy efficiency gains, may offer a vast potential of new forms of flexible demand, by time-shifting of heat production in buildings. The assessment of this potential can, however, be performed only when the limitations imposed by the primary operation of the equipment (space heating) are realistically taken into account. In this paper, a methodology is presented for the quantification of the flexibility offered by the thermal storage of building stock equipped with heat pumps, to power systems with significant penetration of wind power. A model is proposed for the incorporation of the building stock thermal behavior as equivalent energy storage in electricity market models. At the same time, the model allows the coupling to a detailed dynamic thermal model of buildings for the assessment of the respective operational restrictions. The case study presents the results of a project for the evaluation of the flexibility offered by portfolios of high heat pump deployment in conjunction with high wind penetration scenarios for the future German electricity system.},

The EMS provides online set points for each generation unit and signals for consumers based on a demand-side management (DSM) mechanism. The proposed EMS is implemented for a microgrid composed of photovoltaic panels, two wind turbines, a diesel generator and an energy storage system. A coherent forecast information scheme and an economic comparison framework between the RH and the standard unit commitment (UC) are proposed. Solar and wind energy forecasting are based on phenomenological models with updated data. A neural network for two-day-ahead electric consumption forecasting is also designed. The system is tested using real data sets from an existent microgrid in Chile (ESUSCON). The results based on different operation conditions show the economic sense of the proposal. A full practical implementation of the system for ESUSCON is envisioned.},

abstract = {This study explores the integration issues of next-generation high-penetration photovoltaic (PV) systems, where the grid is becoming more decentralised and vulnerable. In that case, the PV systems are expected to be more controllable with higher efficiency and reliability. Provision of ancillary and intelligent services, such as fault ride-through and reactive power compensation, is the key to attain higher utilisation of solar PV energy. Such functionalities for the future PV inverters can contribute to reduced cost of energy, and thus enable more cost-effective PV installations. To implement the advanced features, a flexible power controller is developed in this study, which can be configured in the PV inverter and flexibly change from one to another mode during operation. Based on the single-phase PQ theory, the control strategy offers the possibilities to generate appropriate references for the inner current control loop. The references depend on system conditions and also specific demands from both system operators and prosumers. Besides, this power control strategy can be implemented in commercial PV inverters as a standardised function, and also the operation modes can be achieved online in predesigned PV inverters. Case studies have verified the effectiveness and flexibilities of the proposal to realise the advanced features.},

If properly designed, TES systems can reduce energy costs and consumption, equipment size and pollutant emissions. In order to design efficient control strategies for TES systems, we present a model-based approach with the aim of increasing the performance of HVAC systems with ice cold thermal energy storage (CTES). A simulation environment based on Matlab/Simulink is developed, where thermal behaviour of the plant is analysed by a lumped formulation of the conservation equations. In particular, the ice CTES is modelled as a hybrid system, where the water phase transitions (solid-melting-liquid and liquid-freezing-solid) are described by combining continuous and discrete dynamics, thus considering both latent and sensible heat. Standard control strategies are compared with a non-linear model predictive control (NLMPC) approach. In the simulation examples model predictive control proves to be the best control solution for the efficient management of ice CTES systems. 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The net thermal effect of each shot is to raise the bulk temperature and induce thermal stresses in the conductors. While the high bulk temperature reduces the strength of the material, the cyclic thermal stress may reduce fatigue cycle life of the components. Various estimates of cooling requirements in rail conductors have been done using one-dimensional and two-dimensional approximations. In this study, we carried out a three-dimensional motion computation of the thermal load experienced by the entire length of a laboratory electromagnetic gun for a single shot firing.

abstract = {Analytical expressions obtained from circular plate, elastic beam and cylindrical shell theory are applied to calculate the structural mass of axial-flux permanent-magnet machines for a range of typical wind-turbine ratings. Finite-element models and data from existing low-speed axial-flux machines have been used to gain confidence in the models presented, such that they can be incorporated into design-office programs to rapidly provide a first-order estimate with a reasonable level of accuracy. Results confirm that the inactive mass is greater than 60{\%} of the machine total mass, and at multimegawatt ratings it is almost 90{\%} of the total mass. Optimisation of the machine must therefore include the link between structural and electromagnetic designs. Results presented illustrate the impact of inactive mass on geometrical design parameters and also show that multistage designs can lead to a reduction in mass.},

abstract = {PV inverters are an important element of the future smart grids. Not only they contribute to the active power generation as distributed generators (DGs), but also they can help grid voltage/frequency stability by generating VAR. Although the number of PV installations is rapidly growing, the effective utilization of PV inverters remains low. As even if inverters are to operate in VAR mode during night hours, they still need some active power to compensate for their internal losses, regulate the DC bus and provide the desired level of reactive power. This paper will provide a detailed analysis of PV inverters' operation in VAR compensation mode when active power is not available. A new control scheme is proposed that enables inverter to absorb little active power from grid, regulate its DC bus voltage within limits, and inject the desired level of reactive power. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the analysis.},

These a.c. values are then referred to, say, the primary winding and summed to give the total winding resistance and leakage inductance of the transformer. Formulas are derived and quoted for calculating the d.c. resistances and leakage inductances of the winding portions. Theoretical expressions are derived for the variation with frequency etc. of the factors by which the d.c. values must be multiplied to obtain the corresponding a.c. values.

Power quality improvement with comparison is conducted during fault with proportional integral (PI) and artificial intelligence-based fuzzy logic controlled DVR. MPPT tracks the actual variable DC link voltage while deriving the maximum power from a photovoltaic array and maintains DC link voltage constant by changing modulation index of the converter. Simulation results during fault show that the fuzzy logic based DVR scheme demonstrates simultaneous exchange of active and reactive power with less total harmonic distortion (THD) present in voltage source converter (VSC) current and grid current with fast tracking of optimum operating point at unity power factor. Standards (IEEE-519/1547), stipulates that the current with THD greater than 5{\%} cannot be injected into the grid by any distributed generation source. Simulation results and validations of MPPT technique and operation of fuzzy logic controlled DVR demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.},

The power circuit adopts the LCL type filter to allow universal output that can be operated in both standalone and grid-tie modes. The proposed admittance compensation along with a quasi-proportional-resonant controller is designed to achieve high gain at the fundamental frequency while maintaining enough stability margins. The entire current loop controller and admittance compensation have been simulated and tested with a 5-kW fuel cell prototype. Without the admittance path compensation, simulation results indicate that the system cannot start up smoothly and the zero current command cannot be tracked very well. At first simulation cycle, the power flow erratically fed back to the inverter that may cause catastrophe failure. With admittance path compensation, the time-domain current steady-state error can be easily reduced with the loop gain design in frequency-domain. Simulation and experimental results show that the inverter is capable of both standalone and grid-tie connection mode operations and smooth power flow control even with zero current command.},

Test results from a 1-m-long, 1.27-cm square-bore, plasma-armature railgun have been used to determine the validity of the model. The divergence between the calculated and measured performance is typically less than 5{\%} at railgun currents below 500 kA; however, at currents greater than 500 kA, the deviation increases. Experimental evidence suggests that the railgun's lack of stiffness and subsequent venting of driving pressure rather than the electromechanical model is primarily responsible for the divergence. To test this theory, a rail was built using external preloading rings (Ringfeder) to increase its stiffness. On the first test of the Ringfeder railgun, 625 kA was discharged into the gun and the projectile was accelerated to 5.9 km/s. Test data indicate that the projectile accelerated through the entire length of the railgun and that a minimum amount of plasma leakage occurred during the test},

Serious current clustering may lead to local conductor melting, deforming, and discharge erosion, which are disadvantageous to the launching performance, but the physical principle of VSE has not been extracted and summarized so far. The typical current clustering phenomena in static conductors are classified, and the physical principle of VSE is analyzed for rail and armature respectively in this paper. The physical principle in rails is just Skin Effect because of the short risetime of the accepted pulse current, and the physical principle in armature is Clustering Near Small Source (CNSS) and Clustering Along Short Path (CASP) of steady current owing to the continuity characteristic or the voltage drop. An equivalent steady 3-dimension model has been proposed and adopted, and the quantitative distributions of current for U-shaped and cuboid armatures are simulated contrastively by Maxwell 14.0. The simulation results reveal that the current in the interface trends to cluster along the rear perimeter, and the U-shaped armature is superior to the cuboid armature. The physical principle of VSE has importance for restraining VSE.},

abstract = {—Rotor magnet flux linkage is critical to monitor the state of the permanent magnet in a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). This paper proposes a novel online magnet flux-linkage estimation approach by using measured speed harmonics. The proposed approach is based on the PMSM's mechanical equa-tion, so it is not influenced by magnetic saturation, inverter non-linearity, and changes in machine parameters. The interaction of magnet flux linkage and harmonic current can produce torque harmonic, and thus speed harmonic. Therefore, we explore the use of speed harmonic for magnet flux-linkage estimation. At first, the torque and speed harmonic models are proposed. Then, the mathematical relationship between magnet flux linkage and speed harmonic is developed. Based on this model, a novel magnet flux-linkage estimation approach is proposed, which can eliminate the influence of the cogging torque and spatial harmonics in magnet flux-linkage estimation. The proposed approach is validated on a PMSM drive system under different loads and speeds.},

This method based on a multiobject if genetic algorithm coupled to an analytical model of the MMF produced by the stator windings aims to reduce the harmonic content while maintaining a good winding factor for the working harmonic. The advantage of such an approach is that new degrees of freedom (irregular slot distribution, non-uniform distribution of the number of turns) likely to improve the distribution of the MMF waveform are taken into account. The example of application is given for two specific three phase windings; the first is characterized by a working harmonic of order five and the second by a working harmonic of order seven.},

The GaN Systems GS66508 is the first commercially available 650-V enhancement-mode device. Static and dynamic testing has been performed across the full current, voltage, and temperature range to enable GaN-based converter design using this new device. A curve tracer was used to measure Rds-on across the full operating temperature range, as well as the self-commutated reverse conduction (i.e. diode-like) behavior. Other static parameters such as transconductance and gate current were also measured. A double pulse test setup was constructed and used to measure switching loss and time at the fastest achievable switching speed, and the subsequent over-voltages due to the fast switching were characterized. Based on these results and analysis, an accurate loss model has been developed for the GS66508 to allow for GaN-based converter design and comparison with other commercially available devices in the 600-V class.},

Consequently, a reduction in IMMD size is achieved by eliminating inverter heat sink and optimizing the choice of DC-link capacitors. Gate signals of the IMMD segments are shifted (interleaved) to cancel the capacitor voltage ripple and further reduce the capacitor size. Motor winding configuration and coupling effect are also investigated to match with the IMMD design. An actively controlled balancing resistor is programmed to balance the voltages of series connected IMMD segments.

abstract = {Globally, buildings are responsible for 40{\%} of the total world annual energy consumption which is responsible for one-third of green house gas emissions around the world. A significant portion of this energy is used for lighting, heating, cooling, and air conditioning purposes in buildings. Increasing awareness of the environmental impact of green house gas emissions and CFCs triggered a renewed interest in environmentally friendly cooling, and heating technologies for buildings. Free cooling of buildings may be seen as an alternate to compressor based air conditioning systems used for the buildings. In free cooling, nighttime cold is accumulated in storage material and extracted when needed. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs) can be used for free-cooling purposes due to their high storage density. In free cooling, using PCM as storage material, cool air during night is used to solidify the PCM and the accumulated cold is extracted during the hot day times. In this article a detailed review of work conducted by different researchers on PCM based free cooling is presented. Major challenges being faced in the design of PCM based free cooling system such as phase change materials; their thermo-physical properties and the geometry of encapsulation are elaborated and discussed in detail. Also the parameters effecting the charging and discharging of PCM, effect of phase change temperature and climatic conditions on thermal performance of the free cooling system are also discussed. Potential reduction in CO2 emissions due to the applicability of free cooling systems in residential and commercial buildings is also discussed in this article. This paper also provides a comprehensive list of the PCMs currently being used and that can be used potentially for free cooling applications. At last, this paper also presents some current problems needed further research in this area. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {—This paper proposes an automatic and intelligent stator fault diagnosis system for permanent magnet synchronous generators. The system is based on the use of a feedforward multilayer perception artificial neural network (ANN) performed by the back-propagation training algorithm. From a thorough study and analysis of the behavior of the negative-sequence voltage of the machine under different stator faults and different operating conditions, two new robust indicators of faults are selected as the ANN inputs. The two fault indicators are the phase angle of the negative sequence voltage and the frequency of the machine voltages. After successfully training and testing the ANN with specific and meaningful databases, the ANN behavior is validated by using an experimental database acquired from a real machine. The accurate results provided by the ANN prove the reliability of the proposed system to automatically diagnose different stator faults under variable speed, variable fault current, and variable load conditions overcoming different disturbances, such as the noisy signals and the harmonics in the machine.

On the other hand, EES used for distribution deferral application can support a variety of complementary storage applications such as energy price arbitrage, time of use (TOU) energy cost reduction, wholesale electricity market ancillary services, and transmission upgrade deferral. Aggregation of benefits of these complementary storage applications would have the potential for increasing the amount of EES that may be financially attractive to defer distribution network augmentation in QLD.

In addition, OCT step response as well as the impact of ambient temperature on the OCT performance has been investigated. Results show that optical CTs are more than suitable for replacing conventional CTs. Further, the results also show that OCT has better frequency response than conventional CT. Differences found in the field and laboratory measurements are within experimental errors. Unlike the conventional CT, the OCT can have a digital output according to the IEC 61850 standard. The digital output of the OCT is tested for its frequency-amplitude characteristic. Results confirm that digital output has a narrower bandwidth than the low energy analog output of the OCT due to the limited sampling rate prescribed in a UCA guide to IEC-61850-9-2.},

abstract = {Many geared electric drives can benefit from removing the gearbox and driving directly the load at low speed using a permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings are particularly attractive in low-speed direct drives since they allow, among other advantages, a high number of poles with a limited number of slots. Therefore, this thesis is dedicated to PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings designed for low-speed directdrive applications. First, the design features specific to PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings are presented and illustrated with examples based on finite-element (FE) simulations. Especially, it is shown that the selections of the stator core manufacturing method, the number of winding layers, the combination of pole and slot numbers, and the geometry of the tooth tips are crucial during the design stage of the machine. Second, the benefits of removing the gearbox in a 4.5 kW, 50 rpm mixer used in a waste-water treatment plant are investigated. With its PMSM having buried ferrite magnets and concentrated windings, the designed direct-drive mixer has a higher efficiency than the commercialized geared mixer, but it is also heavier and more expensive due to the larger required housing, shaft and seals. In addition, the cost of the stator core and coil assembly was also higher than expected. Therefore, the difficulties in manufacturing a stator core with concentrated windings are investigated. Mainly due to economical aspects, no prototype motor has been built for the direct-drive mixer. Finally, measurements on a prototype motor at disposal having a large constantpower speed range are performed. Three methods to measure the inductances without using a position sensor are provided and compared. One of the methods is a new test at load conditions to determine the inductance without the knowledge of the rotor position. Results from this method agree well with a conventional blocked rotor test, as well as with results from 3D-FE simulations. Furthermore, the measurements of the magnetic flux obtained with search coils placed in different parts of the stator are analyzed. The analysis allows highlighting the zigzag flux flowing from one magnet to another through a tooth tip, which is characteristic of PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings. It is shown that this zigzag flux leakage causes high iron losses in the tooth tips that represent approximately 50{\%} of the stator iron losses under field weakening operation. Using these measurements, the 3D-FE model of the prototype is also validated thoroughly.},

It offers also the possibility of selective harmonic compensation. However, in case of digital implementation on a low-cost fixed-point DSP, the limited computational power and the limited numerical representation precision can restrict the utilization of it. The present paper proposes a different way of digital implementation of the P+Resonant controller with selective harmonic compensation on a low-cost fixed-point DSP. The resonant part of the P+R has been implemented as a second order filter based on delta operator. The current controller, together with harmonic compensation for the 3{\textless}sup{\textgreater}rd{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, 5{\textless}sup{\textgreater}th{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, and 7{\textless}sup{\textgreater}th{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} harmonics has been successfully tested in practice with a 1.5 KW PV inverter, achieving a 1.2{\%} total harmonic distortion (THD) of the grid current.},

abstract = {A concept is presented along with the overarching structure of the virtual power plant (VPP), the primary vehicle for delivering cost efficient integration of distributed energy resources (DER) into the existing power systems. The growing pressure, primarily driven by environmental concerns, for generating more electricity from renewables and improving energy efficiency have promoted the application of DER into electricity systems. So far, DER have been used to displace energy from conventional generating plants but not to displace their capacity as they are not visible to system operators. If this continues, this will lead to problematic over-capacity issues and under- utilisation of the assets, reduce overall system efficiency and eventually increase the electricity cost that needs to be paid by society. The concept of VPP was developed to enhance the visibility and control of DER to system operators and other market actors by providing an appropriate interface between these system components. The technical and commercial functionality facilitated through the VPP are described and concludes with case studies demonstrating the benefit of aggregation (VPP concept) and the use of the optimal power flow algorithm to characterise VPP.},

In order to achieve this objective the thermal and electrical design of the integrated drive have to be considered together.

abstract = {—In permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM), high-frequency (HF) signal injection has been extensively investigated for permanent magnet temperature (PMT) estimation, in which PMT is estimated from the temperature-dependent HF resistance. Existing studies require prior knowledge on the HF resistance and neglect the fact that PMT is temporally correlated. This paper proposes a state-space model for PMT estimation, in which PMT is modeled with a piecewise linear equation to explore the temporal correlation. The state-space model is nonlinear due to unknown model parameters which is required to be known in existing studies. This paper proposes to use expectation maximization particle filter (EM-PF) for simultaneous PMT and model parameter estimation. After EM-PF estimation, the state-space model becomes linear, so Kalman filter is employed for online PMT estimation. The proposed EM-PF along with a Kalman filter based approach can explore the temporal correlation among PMTs to improve the estimation performance, which can be hardly achieved in existing studies regarding PMT as a time-independent parameter. It should be noted that EM-PF is for initial PMT and model parameter estimation, while Kalman filter is for online PMT estimation ensuring computation-efficiency and realtime capability. Our approach is validated with both numerical and experimental investigations.},

abstract = {Grid-connected converters rely on fast and accurate detection of the phase angle, amplitude and frequency of the utility voltage to guarantee the correct generation of the reference signals. An important issue associated with accurate grid voltage monitoring is the presence of an offset in the measured grid voltage. This voltage offset is typically introduced by the measurements and data conversion processes and causes errors for the estimated parameters of the grid voltage. Accordingly, this paper presents an offset rejection method for grid-connected converters based on a Phase-Locked-Loop (PLL) technique. The offset rejection method relies on the Second Order Generalized Integrator (SOGI) having the advantages of a simple implementation independent of the grid frequency and avoidance of filtering delays due to its resonance at the fundamental frequency. Selected experimental results validate the performance and robustness of the proposed offset rejection method},

RES units, notably inverter-connected wind turbines and photovoltaics (PV) units that do not provide rotational inertia, are effectively displacing conventional generators and their rotating machinery. This has implications for frequency dynamics and power system operation: Since frequency dynamics are faster in power systems with low rotational inertia, this can lead to large transient frequency and power oscillations in multi-area power systems. Grid topology also has a key role for frequency dynamics as meshed grids are more resilient to disturbances than non-meshed grids. This paper investigates the role of low rotational inertia and different grid topology setups on power system stability for a three-area power system. The presented contributions, both analytical and simulation-based insights, extend previous results for a two-area power system.},

abstract = {In several countries, the wind power penetration increased tremendously in recent years. To ensure the proper functioning of the power system, some grid operators already require the capability to provide inertial response or primary control with wind turbines. This paper discusses the emulated inertial response with wind turbines by means of the synthetic inertia and the droop control strategy. The behavior of the synthetic inertia strategy is determined by the inertial and the droop constant, whereas droop control only has a droop constant. When these strategies are used, it is important to tune the control parameters depending on the power system to which the wind turbines are connected. Simulations show that it is possible to enhance but also to deteriorate the frequency response of the system, dependent on these parameters. For different power system compositions, the optimal inertial constant is always close to zero. This way, the synthetic inertia strategy reduces to a fast droop control strategy. This is an important outcome, as it means that no differentiation of the frequency is needed to obtain an optimal inertial response from the wind turbines, which is beneficial in terms of robustness. Consequently, droop control is a viable alternative for the synthetic inertia.},

Instead of utilizing two adjacent active vectors at each switching period as in classic PWM strategies, this new strategy utilizes two nonadjacent active vectors in the case of low-modulation index or three consecutive active vectors in the case of high-modulation index. Analytical calculations show that this new strategy is particularly effective in terms of reducing filtering capacitor rms current for high-power factor compared to space vector PWM which is used as a reference strategy. The impact of this strategy on output current quality is also investigated.},

abstract = {—Electrical signature analysis (ESA) has been success-fully applied to predictive maintenance of synchronous machines. The fault diagnosis is performed by analyzing failure patterns in the current or voltage spectra, which allow the discrimination of a healthy and a faulty condition on the monitored machine. Gener-ally, the failure patterns are a function of the line frequency, rotor rotation frequency, and some structure features of the machine. The rotor rotation frequency pattern, for instance, is indicative of rotor mechanical problems and rotor winding interturn short-circuit. An increase of this frequency component magnitude may indicate the incipience of a rotor fault but may not discriminate the nature of the fault (electrical or mechanical). Thus, it is nec-essary to distinguish the effects of electrical and mechanical faults in these components in order to get a reliable diagnosis of the ma-chine. No works have been found in the literature approaching this specific issue. This paper proposes a simple and innovative method-ology to distinguish the effect of electrical and mechanical faults in the mentioned ESA failure patterns based on the method of sym-metrical components. Its effectiveness is validated by experiments performed on a synchronous generator test rig. The proposed con-dition monitoring system is simple, low cost, and low intrusive, as it only relies on stator electrical quantities. Moreover, it is in operation in a Brazilian 404-MW thermal power station.},

In an attempt to decrease cost of energy, increase the wind energy conversion efficiency, reliability, power density, and comply with the stringent grid codes, the electric generators and power electronic converters have emerged in a rigorous manner. From the market based survey, the most successful generator-converter configurations are addressed along with few promising topologies available in the literature. The back-to-back connected converters, passive generator-side converters, converters for multiphase generators, and converters without intermediate dc-link are investigated for high-power wind energy conversion systems (WECS), and presented in low and medium voltage category. The onshore and offshore wind farm configurations are analyzed with respect to the series/parallel connection of wind turbine ac/dc output terminals, and high voltage ac/dc transmission. The fault-ride through compliance methods used in the induction and synchronous generator based WECS are also discussed. The past, present and future trends in megawatt WECS are reviewed in terms of mechanical and electrical technologies, integration to power systems, and control theory. The important survey results, and technical merits and demerits of various WECS electrical systems are summarized by tables. The list of current and future wind turbines are also provided along with technical details.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {When the wind power accounts for a large portion of the grid power, it may need to help the grid voltage and frequency regulation. This paper investigates a permanent-magnet wind generator with a full power voltage-source converter in weak-grid mode, where the DC-link voltage needs to be controlled from the generator side instead of the grid side. The energy relationship of the wind generator, DC-link energy storage, and load is established. An intrinsic right-half-plane zero, together with the wind power characteristics, the mechanical system inertia, and the DC-link energy storage, is identified as the physical limitations for the control. With the understanding of the system energy relationship and limitations, a hybrid adaptive control algorithm is proposed that searches for the optimal generator acceleration to achieve the maximum wind generator power change rate to match the load power variation. The proposed control scheme is verified through simulation of a 1.5-MW wind system as well as through the experiment of a scaled 1-kW, DSP-/field-programmable-gate-array-controlled, permanent-magnet-generator-based test bed. The results show that it is feasible to regulate DC link by the generator-side converter through the generator speed control. Some important applications issues are also investigated, including the DC-link energy storage requirement, wind speed change impact, and control transition between the weak-grid and strong-grid modes.},

abstract = {Interest in permanent magnet synchronous machines for safety-critical applications has been increasing over the years. One of the most common methods for providing fault tolerance to a permanent magnet machine is the active control from the drive side. This method requires designing machines with the lowest possible mutual coupling between phases and a self-inductance that is high enough to limit the fault currents. Fractional-slot concentrated windings have been proposed as the most advantageous solution to meet these requirements. When comparing the numerous combinations of phases, poles and slots that give rise to a fractional-slot concentrated winding, the usual criteria only focus on obtaining a single-layer winding and do not actually consider the relationship between the self-inductance and the mutual inductance between phases. Moreover, they give no recommendations regarding the optimal number of phases from a magnetic point of view. The present work aims to cover this gap by obtaining analytical expressions for the calculation of the inductances in a permanent magnet machine. The derived expressions are investigated regardless of the geometry of the machine, and the criteria for selecting the most promising combinations in terms of the machine's fault tolerance are extracted.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the active damping of LCL-filter resonance within single-loop grid current control of grid-connected voltage source converters. First, the basic analysis in the continuous s-domain reveals that the grid-current-feedback active damping forms a virtual impedance across the grid-side inductor, and the use of a high-pass filter with a negative sign shapes the virtual impedance by an RL damper paralleled by a negative inductance. It is further found that such a negative virtual inductance plays a critical role in mitigating the phase lag caused by the time delay in a digital control system. The instability induced by the negative virtual resistance, which is commonly experienced in the feedback-type active damping, can thus be avoided. A systematic design method of the highpass filter is also proposed by the help of root locus analysis in the discrete z-domain. Lastly, experimental tests are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.},

@article{Blaabjerg,
abstract = {– The steady growth of installed wind power which reached 200 GW capacity in 2010, together with the up-scaling of the single wind turbine power capability -7 MW's has been announced by manufacturers -has pushed the research and development of power converters towards full scale power conversion, lowered cost pr kW, and increased power density and the need for higher reliability. Substantial efforts are made to comply with the more stringent grid codes, especially grid faults ride-through and reactive power injection, which challenges power converter topologies, because the need for crowbar protection and/or power converter over-rating has been seen in the case of a doubly-fed induction generator. In this paper, power converter technologies are reviewed with focus on single/multi-cell power converter topologies. Further, case studies on the Low Voltage Ride Through demand to power converter technology are presented including a discussion on reliability. It is concluded that as the power level increases in wind turbines, medium voltage power converters will be a dominant power converter configuration.},

This auxiliary circuit provides almost soft switching condition for all switching elements while the control circuit remains PWM. So, the energy conversion through the converter is highly efficient. The proposed converter acts as a ZVT Buck to charge ultracapacitor or battery. On the other hand, it acts as a ZVT Boost to discharge ultracapacitor or battery. Buck operation of the proposed bidirectional converter is analyzed and its operating modes are discussed. The simulation has been done using PSPICE software and its results verify aforementioned capabilities of this converter.},

abstract = {A concept is presented along with the overarching structure of the virtual power plant (VPP), the primary vehicle for delivering cost efficient integration of distributed energy resources (DER) into the existing power systems. The growing pressure, primarily driven by environmental concerns, for generating more electricity from renewables and improving energy efficiency have promoted the application of DER into electricity systems. So far, DER have been used to displace energy from conventional generating plants but not to displace their capacity as they are not visible to system operators. If this continues, this will lead to problematic over-capacity issues and under- utilisation of the assets, reduce overall system efficiency and eventually increase the electricity cost that needs to be paid by society. The concept of VPP was developed to enhance the visibility and control of DER to system operators and other market actors by providing an appropriate interface between these system components. The technical and commercial functionality facilitated through the VPP are described and concludes with case studies demonstrating the benefit of aggregation (VPP concept) and the use of the optimal power flow algorithm to characterise VPP.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a promising approach for developing an integrated traction motor drive based on the Integrated Modular Motor Drive (IMMD) concept. The IMMD concept strives to meet aggressive power density and performance targets by modularizing both the machine and power electronics and then integrating them into a single combined machine-plus-drive structure. Physical integration of the power electronics inside the machine makes it highly desirable to increase the power electronics operating temperature including higher power semiconductor junction temperatures and improved device packaging.$\backslash$nRecent progress towards implementing the IMMD concept in an integrated traction motor drive is summarized in this paper. Several candidate permanent magnet (PM) machine configurations with different numbers of phases between 3 and 6 are analyzed to compare their performance characteristics and key application features. A 6-phase, 10-pole PM machine topology has been selected as the most promising configuration for meeting the major requirements in the areas of power density, efficiency, and module count. A parallel investigation of fault-tolerant distributed control configurations for the IMMD traction drive has led to selection of a heterarchical controller configuration that requires each phase module to be equipped with its own independent microcontroller operating as a peer with all of the other phase module controllers.$\backslash$nThe potential of silicon (Si) insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) operating at junction temperatures up to 200°C has been evaluated using a hardware testbed in terms of device losses and thermal issues. Based on these study results, a 10 kW phase-leg package design using Si IGBTs has been investigated including die selection, material selection, layout design, parasitic extraction and thermal characterization. Thermal performance characterization has been conducted for different packaging structures, operating conditions and coolant selections. The proposed packaging design and cooling approach can maintain the Si IGBT junction temperature below 200°C with an ambient temperature of 150°C.},

This paper investigates the grid-voltage-feedforward active damping for grid connected inverter with LCL filter. It reveals that proportional feedforward control can not only fulfill the mitigation of grid disturbance, but also offer damping effects on the LCL filter resonance. Digital delays are intrinsic to digital controlled inverters; with these delays, the feedforward control can be equivalent to a damping resistor and a reactance paralleled with filter capacitor. The damping performance in different frequency regions are discussed through Bode diagrams. Compared to other widely used active damping strategies, no extra sensor is needed because the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) voltage is sampled for Phase Locked Loop (PLL).

This paper focuses on the connection of wind generators at locations where the level of ERG would be limited by the voltage rise. Short-term storage, covering less than 1 h, offers only a small increase in the amount of electricity that can be absorbed by the network. Storage over periods of up to one day delivers greater energy benefits, but is significantly more expensive. Different feasible electricity storage technologies are compared for their operational suitability over different time scales. The value of storage in relation to power rating and energy capacity has been investigated so as to facilitate appropriate sizing.},

abstract = {Battelle's Columbus Division recently completed a Small Caliber Electromagnetic Launcher (EML) Engineering Feasibility Study Program under funding from the U.S. Army Armament Research and Development Center Joint Services Small Arms Program. Included in the study program was a preliminary feasibility and conceptual design study of a novel, hybrid EML with a pulsed, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator power supply. This concept was evolved by Battelle under an earlier Joint Services Small Arms Program Office effort. The system to be designed was a 0.30 caliber, tactical, portable EML capable of accelerating a 2.5 g projectile to near 1500 m/s, using a 1 m railgun and a solid armature. A first-order performance model for the integrated EML and generator was developed and implemented on a personal computer. Trade studies were conducted on numerous parameters of interest, and required propellant and other characteristics were specified. Results of the model development and trade studies are presented herein, and they indicate that significant technology advances are required to weaponize this EML concept. For the purposes of conducting the necessary para- metric studies, a baseline launcher configuration was specified. A 1 m long generator and a 1 m long railgun were selected, with an average generator channel diameter of 25.4 mm, and a railgun bore diameter of 7.62 mm. Rails and electrodes were taken to be copper for all cases. The downstream 50{\%} of the MHD channel was made active, with the magnetic field provided by external, battery-powered saddle coils. The projectile was initially accelerated by a pressure sufficient that 200 m/s velocity was reached by the time the current is first applied, The baseline generator characteristics were taken as: a 5 T magnetic flux density, a 2000 m/s plasma velocity, and an effective plasma conductivity of 2000 mho/m. With such a generator, a projectile muzzle velocity of 1520 m/s is predicted.},

abstract = {Currently, assemblies of power semiconductor switches and their associated drive circuitry are available in modules. MOSFETs and IGBTs are used as switches and these elec- tric gated devices facilitate the incorporation of gate driving functions in the module. These mod- ules are sometimes also provided with limited internal sensing and protection functions. From a few 100 watts downward, one finds silicon monolithic technology as the integration vehicle, while upward into the multi-kilowatt range, mixed mode module construction is used. This incorporates monolithic, hybrid, surface mount and wirebond technology. However, a close examination of the applications in motor drives and power supplies indicates that there has been no dramatic volume reduction of the subsystem. The power semiconductor modules have shrunk the power switching part of the converter, but the bulk of the subsystem volume still comprises the associated control, sensing, electromagnetic power passives (inductors, transformers, capacitors) and interconnect structures. The article addresses the improvement of power processing technology through advanced inte- gration of power electronics. The goal of a subsystem in a module necessitates this advanced inte- gration. The central philosophy of the technology development research in the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Power Electronic Systems is to advance the state of the art by providing the concept of integrated power electronics modules (IPEMs). The technology underpinning such an IPEM approach is discussed. The fundamental functions in electronic power processing, the materials, processes and integration approaches and future concepts are explained. Ample use is made of illustrations, photographs of integrated modules and subsystems to en- hance the value of the article to the non-specialist},

abstract = {Capacitors are one type of reliability-critical components in power electronic systems. In the last two decades, many efforts in academic research have been devoted to the condition monitoring of capacitors to estimate their health status. Industry applications are demanding more reliable power electronics products with preventive maintenance. Nevertheless, most of the developed capacitor condition monitoring technologies are rarely adopted by industry due to the complexity, increased cost, and other relevant issues. An overview of the prior-art research in this area is therefore needed to justify the required resources and the corresponding performance of each key method. It serves to provide a guideline for industry to evaluate the available solutions by technology benchmarking, as well as to advance the academic research by discussing the history development and the future opportunities. Therefore, this paper first classifies the capacitor condition monitoring methods into three categories, then the respective technology evolution in the last two decades is summarized. Finally, the state-of-the-art research and the future opportunities targeting for industry applications are given.},

The effectiveness of this control strategy has been tested by using an actual wind farm data.

The vehicle acceleration and thrust force characteristics previewed from that model are verified and analyzed by practical measurements and a set of essays using the prototype built in our laboratory. Major errors came for thermally activated flux creep and current conduction in the YBCO during its passage through the excitation system. The total magnetic field at the superconductor's surface decreases, reducing thrust force. Despite these secondary effects, achieved results show the potential of this new approach for future electric propulsion systems.  1982-2012 IEEE.},

The propagation of the disturbance from the torque disturbance to the motor current, then to the dc link current, and finally to the rectifier input current is derived as a series of transfer functions, so that both the frequency and the amplitude of the disturbance component in the rectifier input cur-rent can be predicted for a specific mechanical disturbance. The limitations to detect the mechanical fault by monitoring only the supply currents are also addressed.

abstract = {Many grid connected power electronic systems, such as STATCOMs, UPFCs, and distributed generation system interfaces, use a voltage source inverter (VSI) connected to the supply network through a filter. This filter, typically a series inductance, acts to reduce the switching harmonics entering the distribution network. An alternative filter is a LCL network, which can achieve reduced levels of harmonic distortion at lower switching frequencies and with less inductance, and therefore has potential benefits for higher power applications. However, systems incorporating LCL filters require more complex control strategies and are not commonly presented in literature. This paper proposes a robust strategy for regulating the grid current entering a distribution network from a three-phase VSI system connected via a LCL filter. The strategy integrates an outer loop grid current regulator with inner capacitor current regulation to stabilize the system. A synchronous frame PI current regulation strategy is used for the outer grid current control loop. Linear analysis, simulation, and experimental results are used to verify the stability of the control algorithm across a range of operating conditions. Finally, expressions for ""harmonic impedance" of the system are derived to study the effects of supply voltage distortion on the harmonic performance of the system.},

abstract = {This thesis focuses on permanent magnet "direct drive" electrical generators for wind turbines with large power output. A variety of such generator topologies is reviewed, tested and optimised in an attempt to increase their potential as commercial concepts for the wind industry. Direct drive electrical generators offer a reliable alternative to gearbox drivetrains. This novel technology reduces energy loses thus allowing more energy to be yield from the wind and decreases the maintenance cost at the same time. A fundamental issue for these generators is their large size which makes them difficult to manufacture, transport and assembly. A number of structural designs have been suggested in the literature in an attempt to minimise this attribute. A set of design tools are set out in an attempt to investigate the structural stiffness of the different permanent magnet direct drive generator topologies against a number of structural stresses that apply to such wind turbine energy converters. Optimisation techniques, both analytical and structural, are also developed for minimising the total mass of a variety of "directly driven" machines with power output of 5MW or greater. Conventional and promising generator designs are modelled and optimised with the use of these optimisation techniques. The topologies under examination are then compared in terms of structural mass, stiffness and cost. As the number of wind turbine manufactures who adopt the direct drive concept increases, it is important to outline the unique characteristics of the different topologies and increase their manufacturing potential. Discussions and conclusions will provide an indication of the design solutions that could help decrease the mass and cost of such machines.},

abstract = {The design and experimental results of a 40-stage distributed energy store (DES) plasma arc railgun are presented. The railgun drives a free running hypervelocity plasma arc, one that is not pushing a payload, to velocities in excess of 10 km/s. These high velocities are of interest as they are required to successfully launch payloads into low earth orbit (LEO). The ability to launch payloads into LEO using a hypervelocity electromagnetic launcher has many financial benefits over the more conventional chemical combustion launchers. In collaboration with an Air Force Office of Scientific Research funded Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative project, the Center for Pulsed Power and Power Electronics at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas has been responsible for developing and investigating a functional scale model of a multistage DES railgun to determine its effectiveness to suppress restrike phenomenon and increase plasma armature railgun performance. The distributed energy scheme is theorized to suppress restrike arc formation because the back emf voltage is localized to active stage regions where high gas density and low temperature inhibits breakdown. B-dot sensors positioned along the length of the launcher provide data to measure the plasma arc velocity and detect restrike, arc splitting, or additional secondary arc formation phenomena.},

Due to the increasing number of DPGSs connected to the utility network, new and stricter standards in respect to power quality, safe running, and islanding protection are issued. As a consequence, the control of distributed generation systems should be improved to meet the requirements for grid interconnection. This paper gives an overview of the structures for the DPGS based on fuel cell, photovoltaic, and wind turbines. In addition, control structures of the grid-side converter are presented, and the possibility of compensation for low-order harmonics is also discussed. Moreover, control strategies when running on grid faults are treated. This paper ends up with an overview of synchronization methods and a discussion about their importance in the control},

This is a complex task: besides the large amplitudes of the in-bore magnetic fields due to the pulsed current, the exit of the projectile from the muzzle and the consequences of plasma arcs have to be considered. At the muzzle the magnetic induction can drop from several Teslas to zero within some microseconds, leading to very high induced voltages and electric fields in the metallic parts of the projectile. On the other hand, the electric contact established by solid armatures tends to develop into electric arcs at high velocities during the launch. These plasma arcs as well as the closing switch transients of the railgun circuit are a source of electromagnetic radiation in a broad spectral range. Some electronic devices were selected and tested with static setups corresponding to the previous conditions. In a first phase a series of static railgun experiments (no projectile movement) was performed. In a second phase, static experiments simulating the muzzle exit conditions were carried out. Finally, the influence of electromagnetic waves emitted during railgun experiments on electronic devices was investigated, using a static setup with a conventional spark gap.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new method for optimal sizing of an energy storage system (ESS) in a microgrid (MG) for storing electrical/renewable energy at the time of surplus and for re-dispatching. The unit commitment problem with spinning reserve for MG is considered in this new method. The total cost function, which includes the cost of ESS, cost of output power and cost of spinning reserve, is introduced. The effectiveness of the approach is validated by a case study where the optimal ESS rating for MG is determined. The quantitative results show that the ESS with an optimal size is not only storing renewable energy and re-dispatching it appropriately, but also saving the the total cost for MG. The main method is formulated as a mixed nonlinear integer problem (MNIP), which is solved in AMPL (A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming).},

abstract = {—In this study, a signal-based predictive fault-detection approach is developed to identify potential faults within an elec-tric motor. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, first artificial motor vibration data are produced and used as a base line for analysis and assessment of the methodology. After successfully confirming proof of concept by detecting all fault frequencies hidden within the artificial data, the approach is then applied to the experimental data to see whether it can be accepted as a suitable potential fault detection tool for healthy electric mo-tors. As the keystone of the study, algebraic summation operation (ASO) is introduced for predictive fault detection. ASO is built and based upon the redundant nature of stationary wavelet transform (SWT). Although similar to the SWT, the down sampling operation defined for the perfect reconstruction of SWT is omitted in ASO to amplify the redundancy within the transform. In other words, the redundancy obtained during decomposition is conserved on purpose with the goal of amplifying potential fault frequencies in electric motor vibration spectra and allowing for more robust and predictive fault detection.},

abstract = {As the penetration of variable renewable generation increases in power systems worldwide, planning for the effects of variability will become more important. Traditional capacity adequacy planning techniques have been supplemented with integration studies, which have been carried out in power systems with high targets for renewable generation. These have highlighted the increased variability that a system may experience in the future. As system generation planning techniques evolve with the challenge of integrating variable generation, the flexibility of a system to manage periods of high variability needs to be assessed. The insufficient ramping resource expectation (IRRE) metric is proposed to measure power system flexibility for use in long-term planning, and is derived from traditional generation adequacy metrics. Compared to existing generation adequacy metrics, flexibility assessment is more data intensive. A flexibility metric can identify the time intervals over which a system is most likely to face a shortage of flexible resources, and can measure the relative impact of changing operational policies and the addition of flexible resources. The flexibility of a test system with increasing penetrations of variable generation is assessed. The results highlight the time horizons of increased and decreased risk associated with the integration of VG.},

The frequency components of interest are in the range of two to four times the value of the supply frequency, which simpli-fies the implementation with relatively low-cost instrumentation.

The results show that interleaving has the potential benefit to reduce ac passive components.

GaN HEMT devices, exhibiting high power densities coupled with high breakdown voltages, have opened up the possibilities for highly efficient power amplifiers (PAs) exploiting the principles of waveform engineered designs. This paper summarizes the unique advantages of GaN HEMTs compared to other power transistor technologies, with examples of where such features have been exploited. Since RF power densities of GaN HEMTs are many times higher than other technologies, much attention has also been given to thermal management—examples of both commercial “off-the-shelf” packaging as well as custom heat-sinks are described. The very desirable feature of having accurate large-signal models for both discrete transistors and monolithic microwave integrated circuit foundry are emphasized with a number of circuit design examples. GaN HEMT technology has been a major enabler for both very broadband high-PAs and very high-efficiency designs. This paper describes examples of broadband amplifiers, as well as several of the main areas of high-efficiency amplifier design—notably Class-D, Class-E, Class-F, and Class-J approaches, Doherty PAs, envelope-tracking techniques, and Chireix outphasing.},

This paper presents a novel procedure for real-time diagnosis of hunting in LSIPM motors based on stator current signatures. Torsional vi-bration associated with hunting in a LSIPM motor influences the electrical supply, and introduces variable amplitude lower and up-per sidebands in the stator current. In this paper, wavelet packet decomposition is applied to perform multiresolution analysis of the nonstationary current signals for detection and extraction of the sideband frequency components superimposed on the funda-mental. Statistical techniques are applied on the extracted data signals and a signature for the diagnosis of hunting phenomenon is established. The proposed technique is validated by performing finite element analysis (FEA) of two three-phase four-pole LSIPM motors of different power ratings for various case scenarios. Ex-perimental investigations have been carried out for a three-phase four-pole 208-V, 1-HP LSIPM motor drive in order to validate the performance of the proposed method under various operating conditions. Based on FEA and experimental results, the proposed technique can successfully diagnose the hunting phenomenon with-out a vibration sensor.

These are optimized using a hybrid genetic algorithm and pattern search process and the results show that the surface-mounted permanent magnet generator produces the lower cost of energy. The choice of objective function is addressed and it is found that a simplified metric incorporating generator cost and losses proxy produces similar designs to a full cost of energy calculation. Further steps to improve the quality of the model include the effect of generator mass on the design and cost of the turbine tower and foundation, which can add €0.4 m to the turbine cost. Further optimizations are carried out to show the impacts of magnetic material costs (doubling this leads to a €1.1/MWh increase in cost of energy) and generator diameter limits (increasing the upper limit from 6 to 8 m leads to a 0.9{\%} drop in cost of energy) have on the choice of optimum independent variables.},

The feedback loop employing the derivative of the grid frequency aims to improve the inertial response while the feedback loop employing the grid frequency deviation introduces a droop at the rectifier control loop. When the grid frequency is too high or too low, active power flow through the HVdc link will be ramped down or up.

abstract = {This paper presents an overview of motor drive technologies used for safety-critical aerospace applications, with a particular focus placed on the choice of candidate machines and their drive topologies. Aircraft applications demand high reliability, high availability, and high power density while aiming to reduce weight, complexity, fuel consumption, operational costs, and environmental impact. New electric driven systems can meet these requirements and also provide significant technical and economic improvements over conventional mechanical, hydraulic, or pneumatic systems. Fault-tolerant motor drives can be achieved by partitioning and redundancy through the use of multichannel three-phase systems or multiple single-phase modules. Analytical methods are adopted to compare caged induction, reluctance, and PM motor technologies and their relative merits. The analysis suggests that the dual (or triple) three-phase PMAC motor drive may be a favored choice for general aerospace applications, striking a balance between necessary redundancy and undue complexity, while maintaining a balanced operation following a failure. The modular single-phase approach offers a good compromise between size and complexity but suffers from high total harmonic distortion of the supply and high torque ripple when faulted. For each specific aircraft application, a parametrical optimization of the suitable motor configuration is needed through a coupled electromagnetic and thermal analysis, and should be verified by finite-element analysis.},

The loss model includes power dissipation in the drivers, as well as conduction and switching losses in the power MOSFET devices. For a given set of operating conditions, the power loss model allows optimum selection of the design parameters: the gate- drive tapering factor, the gate-drive voltage swings, and the widths of the power MOSFET devices. As an example, modeling and optimization results are described for a 2-to-1 V, 200 mA converter in a standard 0.35$\mu$ CMOS process, with switching frequencies in the range from 1 MHz to 10 MHz. The modeling and optimization results are validated by detailed circuit simulations.},

abstract = {—Bearing is one of the most critical components in most electrical and power drives. Effective bearing fault diagnosis is im-portant for keeping the electrical and power drives safe and oper-ating normally. In the age of Internet of Things and Industrial 4.0, massive real-time data are collected from bearing health monitor-ing systems. Mechanical big data have the characteristics of large volume, diversity, and high velocity. There are two major problems in using the existing methods for bearing fault diagnosis with big data. The features are manually extracted relying on much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and diagnostic ex-pertise, and the used models have shallow architectures, limiting their capability in fault diagnosis. Effectively mining features from big data and accurately identifying the bearing health conditions with new advanced methods have become new issues. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for bearing fault diag-nosis. The presented approach preprocesses sensor signals using short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Based on a simple spectrum matrix obtained by STFT, an optimized deep learning structure, large memory storage retrieval (LAMSTAR) neural network, is built to diagnose the bearing faults. Acoustic emission signals ac-quired from a bearing test rig are used to validate the presented method. The validation results show the accurate classification per-formance on various bearing faults under different working condi-tions. The performance of the presented method is also compared with other effective bearing fault diagnosis methods reported in the literature. The comparison results have shown that the pre-sented method gives much better diagnostic performance, even at relatively low rotating speeds. Index Terms—Acoustic emission (AE) sensor, bearing fault diag-nosis, deep learning, large memory storage retrieval (LAMSTAR) neural network.},

abstract = {—Early detection of incipient faults in ac drives is one of the most difficult challenges for condition monitoring, especially for faults related to insulation degradation of the windings. In low power motors, the insulation degradation is principally due to the steep voltage variations caused by the voltage source converters that drive the machines. In the last years, with the coming to market of new no-Si based power devices, which achieve great values of dv/dt, fast tracking of electrical fault has became a topic of primary importance. In this paper, a new method to detect the presence of incipient faults in ultrareliable electric machines is presented and compared with a previous solution. The different methods were extensively evaluated by means of experimental results. It is shown that potential winding faults can be detected at an early stage of fault inception and thus measures can be taken to limit propagation.

As the renewable energy sector grows, the need for engineers qualified to design such systems grows as well. In order to train such engineers, new courses are needed that highlight the unique engineering challenges presented by renewable energy systems. This paper presents the theory, implementation, and assessment of a new laboratory course designed to teach power electronics and renewable energy to engineering students. A key element of the course is the use of real renewable energy systems in the laboratory setting. Students design, test, and troubleshoot power electronic circuits (such as dc/dc converters and pulse-width-modulated inverters) with tools used widely in industry (such as MATLAB/Simulink and dSPACE digital signal processors). Ten unique experiments are presented, as well as detailed descriptions of two open-ended design projects: a maximum power point tracker for a photovoltaic array and a full converter for a permanent-magnet wind turbine. Results from students' work on the experiments and final projects, as well as an assessment of the effectiveness of the course based on pre- and post-testing, are also presented. {\textcopyright} 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {SUMMARY This paper explores how adding power flow devices incrementally to constrained transmission lines provides benefits to both wind generation developers and transmission owners. Capital is only spent when it is necessary, generation developers can be charged incrementally, in-service dates can be accelerated and congestion can be relieved providing economic benefits to the region. Introduction Utility scale wind deployments in the US have increased rapidly over the last decade and according to interconnection request data in various regions, additional deployments are expected. Renewable energy expansion subjects stakeholders, such as transmission owners (TOs) and generation developers, to uncertainty including schedule uncertainty, location uncertainty, financial uncertainty and operational uncertainty. These uncertainties are in addition to the greater uncertainty that TOs are facing compared to the era of vertically integrated utilities with coordinated transmission and generation planning. All of these factors impact the scope, timeline and cost of transmission expansion required to successfully interconnect and operate new wind generation customers. This paper reviews the challenges of wind interconnection from the TO's perspective and discusses the possibility of employing scalable power flow control solutions on the existing transmission system in order to minimize this uncertainty in all four dimensions while also reducing or eliminating transmission congestion on existing transmission lines. Scalable power flow control allows transmission utilities to interconnect new generation customers in a flexible manner, bring generation online sooner and allocate costs to customers incrementally. Further, it can provide a cost effective way to minimize congestion that can result in curtailing wind generators during critical load periods. Consequences of Transmission Constraints Utility-scale wind deployments in the US have increased rapidly over the last decade. Financial incentives, state and federal regulations, and climate change concerns continue to drive the construction of more renewable capacity, and the EPA's proposed clean power plan is adding an additional layer of uncertainty. Constraints on the transmission grid tend to be one of the main challenges to integrating utility scale wind generators. These constraints cause two main issues:  Certain constraints must be resolved before a wind generator can be brought online initially, increasing the fixed cost of wind deployment.  Constraints may cause congestion at certain times resulting in wind generators being curtailed (turned off) even when the wind is blowing, reducing generator revenue.  The cost and time to address some transmission constraints may derail certain generation projects altogether.},

abstract = {In permanent magnet synchronous machine, high-frequency (HF)
signal injection has been extensively investigated for permanent magnet
temperature (PMT) estimation, in which PMT is estimated from the
temperature-dependent HF resistance. Existing studies require prior
knowledge on the HF resistance and neglect the fact that PMT is
temporally correlated. This paper proposes a state-space model for PMT
estimation, in which PMT is modeled with a piecewise linear equation to
explore the temporal correlation. The state-space model is nonlinear due
to unknown model parameters, which is required to be known in existing
studies. This paper proposes to use expectation maximization particle
filter (EM-PF) for simultaneous PMT and model parameter estimation.
After EM-PF estimation, the state-space model becomes linear, so Kalman
filter is employed for online PMT estimation. The proposed EM-PF along
with a Kalman-filter-based approach can explore the temporal correlation
among PMTs to improve the estimation performance, which can be hardly
achieved in existing studies regarding PMT as a time-independent
parameter. It should be noted that EM-PF is for initial PMT and model
parameter estimation, while Kalman filter is for online PMT estimation
ensuring computation efficiency and real-time capability. Our approach
is validated with both numerical and experimental investigations.},

This paper presents a benchmarking of SiC-MOSFET and Si-IGBT power devices with the voltage rating of 1200V in 2-Level Full-Bridge (2L-FB) inverter for 10kW small scale wind turbine. By simulation, the inverter performance is evaluated in the presence of the wind speed distribution profile and the reference switching frequency value for SiC devices in this topology at this power level is determined.

The details of the sensing head redesign are illustrated. Also, both electronic processing block and harmonic analysis algorithm have been illustrated. The practical application of the so-redesigned device has been successfully verified experimentally at a thermal power plant. The measurements have been made for the operation of a 6-kV induction motor with different load conditions and the thyristor excitation of a 15-kV alternating current generator. The experimentally determined current waveforms, the corresponding relative harmonic content computed by discrete Fourier transform, and total harmonic current distortion for various measuring points have been displayed. Important requirements for accurate harmonic measurements have been discussed. The results clearly verified the applicability of the FOCS for monitoring electric power quality as suggested in this paper},

abstract = {The injected grid current regulator and active damping of the LCL filter are essential to the control of LCL-type grid-connected inverters. Generally speaking, the current regulator guarantees the quality of the injected grid current, and the active damping reduces the resonance peak caused by the LCL filter and makes it easier to stabilize the whole system. However, the frequency responses of the current regulator and active damping interact with each other, making it difficult to design the proper controller parameters and investigate the effect of the controller parameters. Taking proportional-integral (PI) compensator together with capacitor-current-feedback active-damping as an instance, this paper proposes a step-by-step design method of the current regulator and capacitor current feedback coefficient in both analog control and digital control. By carefully dealing with the interaction between the current regulator and active damping, the satisfactory regions of the controller parameters are obtained based on stability margin and steady-state error checking, making it more convenient and explicit to optimize the performance of the system. The convenient trial-and-error procedures are successfully reduced. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed design method.},

The proposed model considers the package and PCB parasitic inductances, the nonlinearity of the junction capacitors, and the transconductance of the cascode GaN transistor. The switching process is illustrated in detail, including the interaction of the low voltage Si MOSFET and the high voltage GaN HEMT in cascode configuration. The switching loss is obtained by solving the equivalent circuits during the switching transition. The analytical results show that the turn-on loss dominates in hard-switching conditions while the turn-off loss is negligible, due to the intrinsic current source driving mechanism. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by numerous experimental results. The results of both the analytical model and experiments suggest that soft-switching is critical for high voltage GaN in high-frequency high-efficiency applications.},

The complex task of PMSM control in high-performance applications is currently usually resolved with classical vector control. Modern control techniques such as model predictive control can provide significant benefits over field oriented control, especially with straightforward controller tuning and constraints handling. Unfortunately, these new algorithms usually suffer from problems with their computational complexity. In the current paper, we present a PMSM control method based on an explicit model predictive control with a novel linearization and constraints handling method, allowing natural field weakening. The algorithm was designed with respect to computationally feasible implementation in the control hardware. The proposed control algorithm has been proved and successfully verified in both simulation and implementation on a real motor.},

The typical switching frequency of the commercial medium power rating inverter, however, is limited to tens of kHz. By increasing the switching frequency and using emerging gallium-nitride devices, the size of the overall system can be greatly reduced. This paper begins by reviewing all commercially available GaN power transistors and their package technologies. The GS66516T device from GaN Systems is selected due to its suitable ratings and superior package performance. Then, a half-bridge structure is designed for this device to achieve low parasitic inductance and strong cooling capability at the same time. The dynamic characterization results of this 650V/60A Enhancement-mode GaN transistor are extracted with the proposed half-bridge structure. A gate drive circuit with comprehensive protection function is integrated. Based on the proposed phase-leg structure, a 10 kW three phase inverter prototype is built and the experimental waveform is shown at the end.},

abstract = {The future power systems face several challenges; one of them is the use of high power converters that virtually decouple primary energy source from the AC power grid. An important consequence of this situation is their effect on total system inertia and the ability to overcome the system's frequency disturbances. The wind power industry has created a controller to enable inertial response on wind turbines generators: Synthetic Inertial. This paper evaluates the effects of the inertia emulation of wind turbines based on full-converters and their effect on total system inertia after frequency disturbances happen. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate (based on simulations) that during an under-frequency transients on future power systems, synthetic inertia does not completely avoid worse scenarios in terms of under-frequency load shedding. The extra power delivered from a wind turbine during frequency disturbances can increase “momentary” the total system inertia and substantially reduce the rate of change of frequency providing time for the active governors to respond. However, synthetic inertia might not completely avoid under-frequency load shedding.},

abstract = {—Intelligent fault detection in induction motors (IMs) is a widely studied research topic. Various artificial-intelligence-based approaches have been proposed to deal with a large amount of data obtained from destructive laboratory testing. However, in real applications, such volume of data is not always available due to the effort required in obtaining the predictors for classifying the faults. Therefore, in realistic scenarios, it is necessary to cope with the small-data problem, as it is known in the literature. Fault-related instances along with healthy state observations obtained from the IM compose datasets that are usually imbalanced, where the number of instances classified as the faulty class (minority) is much lower than those classified under the healthy class (ma-jority). This paper presents a novel supervised classification ap-proach for IM faults based on the adaptive boosting algorithm with an optimized sampling technique that deals with the imbal-anced experimental dataset. The stator current signal is used to compose a dataset with features both from the time domain and from the frequency domain. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher performance metrics than others classifiers used in this field for the incipient detection and classification of faults in IM.},

This inverter topology provides a fault-tolerant solution to any open-circuit and certain short-circuit switching faults in the power devices. During any of the fault-tolerant operation modes for these device faults, there is no derating required in the inverter output voltage or output power. In addition, overload capability is increased in this new T-type inverter compared to that in the conventional three-level T-type inverter. Such increase in inverter overload capability is due to the utilization of the redundant leg for overload current sharing with other main phase legs under healthy condition. Moreover, if the redundant phase leg is composed of silicon carbide metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors, quasi-zero-voltage switching, and zero-current switching of the silicon insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) in the conventional main phase legs can be achieved at certain switching states, which can significantly relieve the thermal stress on the outer IGBTs and improve the whole inverter efficiency.

This study explored a range of bore and rail geometries and looked at their effects on key railgun system parameters such as parasitic mass, inductance gradient, linear current density, required pulse forming network (PFN) size, and barrel mass. Preliminary solid modeling and structural analysis of the integrated launch package was performed in order to quantify parasitic mass. Inductance gradient calculations were based on a current density distribution analysis. A PFN/Launcher numerical simulation model was then used to determine linear current density and PFN size. Finally, barrel mass was estimated by structural analysis based on calculated rail repulsive forces. Trends and sensitivities of the different parameters to changes in the bore and rail geometries are presented and conclusions are given.},

abstract = {Parameters identification of permanent magnetic synchronous motor (PMSM), which significantly influences the control performance of the drive system, is an impor-tant and challenging task of power electronic system. The problem requires both high solution quality and fast conver-gence speed due to the constraints of hardware. This paper presents a self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm with hybrid mutation operator (SHDE) for parameters identifi-cation problem. In this method, a novel mutation operator, called " current-to-archive-best, " is developed by mixing the best solutions randomly selected from archive set and current population. Thus, the algorithm could use the best searching memories so far to generate promising solutions, yielding a faster evolving procedure. Besides, the corresponding control parameters of SHDE are also self-adapted without tedious trial-and-error progress to get appropriate values. Moreover, the parameters estimation program is inserted into the PMSM simulation that is solved by using Newton–Raphson method without any pre-assumption and simplification. This frame-work, which may be used under any working conditions with large disturbance, is different from other publications, resulting in wider applications. The proposed method applied to parameters identification of PMSM is evaluated on a PMSM drive system with two different operations. The com-prehensive results and statistical analyses, compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, show that SHDE could find high-quality solutions with higher convergence speed and probability.

abstract = {The results of mathematical simulation of thermal, mechanical and electromagnetic interaction of railgun plasma armature and channel walls are presented. A generalized 2D-approach taking into account turbulent friction, radiative and turbulent heat transfer and spatial inhomogeneity of the magnetic field was used. The heat regime of electrodes was considered in the 2D-approach. The momentum and energy transfer from the flow core to the electrodes and the process of involving the erosion mass into acceleration were investigated in detail. It has been shown that magnetic field inhomogeneity causing the appearance of spatial induction currents influences essentially the momentum, energy and mass balance in the near-electrode region and the armature characteristics as a whole. It leads to an additional drag force and the release of Joule heat near the rail surface and to the increase in erosion. Under some conditions this can cause instability of plasma armature and its sharp extension. Calculations have shown that the electrode melting, destruction of the liquid film, involving of drops into acceleration and their vaporization in the flow seem to be the most probable mechanism of plasma mass increase for typical regimes of railgun operation},

abstract = { Most infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filter implementations in power electronic inverter applications are based on the time shift operator q and its associated z-transform. But for higher sampling frequencies where the sample period approaches zero for z-transform discrete systems, their dynamic response does not converge smoothly to the continuous counterpart, causing substantial implementation problems. In contrast, the response of filters based on the delta operator does converge to the continuous counterpart for smaller sample periods, and hence they are much better suited for digital control applications where sampling frequencies are much higher than the system poles. This paper describes the basis of the delta operator, its use for IIR digital filter systems, and shows how the technique can be used in power electronic inverter applications to achieve substantial performance benefits compared to equivalent shift-based implementations. A brief review of shift based IIR filtering is presented and the required conversions to the delta form given. The specific examples of an active filter and a P + Resonant current regulator are used to illustrate the improvements that can be expected. The superior performance of the delta operator for digital control of inverter applications has been verified in both simulation and experiment.},

abstract = {—This (patent-pending) paper presents a new method for detection of rotor winding intercoil short circuits of syn-chronous machines and slip rings induction machines, as well as rupture of rotor bars and cage ring of induction machines. It is based on differential measurement of magnetic field by using two measuring coils. Measuring the coil-induced voltage enables us to detect rotor winding faults, which means that measured voltage is approximately zero without fault and increases in the presence of fault. Analysis of the measuring signal enables us to detect and locate fault. This new method enables rotor winding fault detection with high sensitivity, which enables more reliable fault detection. In comparison with the motor current signature analysis method, this new method gives 200 times higher sensitivity to fault occur-rence. Numerous finite-element (FE) simulations have been carried out to verify the method. Also, this method was experimentally validated via series of laboratory tests on the specially designed electric machines for fault study (broken rotor bars, broken ring and intercoil short circuit in a rotor winding). Additionally, this method is applied on more than 20 real machines in industry. This patent-pending method is already implemented in three innovative products placed on market, so this method is fully confirmed in practice.},

The topology has many benefits such as; absence of cogging torque, reduced mass and ease of manufacturing. A 20 kW prototype test rig and 15kW machine for a wind turbine has been manufactured and tested previously. Initial sizing studies for wind turbines indicate that the C-GEN concept will be up to 50{\%} lighter than conventional iron cored PM direct drive generators [1]. In addition to the applications wind turbines, C-GEN technology can also be implemented for marine energy power take-off systems. To investigate that, a feasibility study is being undertaken in collaboration with two wave and two tidal energy companies. In this paper, design and optimization method of an axial flux permanent magnet generator for a tidal energy converter device has been investigated. An analytical optimization tool is designed that combines electromagnetic, structural and thermal aspects of the machine design. A genetic algorithm optimization method has been utilized based on the operation conditions of generator and pre-defined constraints on dimensions and material limitations. The output of the analytical design tool is compared with the electromagnetic FEA simulations. The results showed that proposed analytical calculation method is consistent with FEA results},

abstract = {In grid-connected LCL-filtered inverters, the dual-loop current control is widely used. The LCL resonance is highly damped by proper feedback of the capacitor current. To suppress low-frequency current harmonics, a grid-voltage feedforward is commonly used. However, the system performance with such control is declined when connecting to a weak grid. Phase and gain margins are largely reduced while the proportional feedforward is used. The margins get worse and instability is aroused if the derivative feedforward is further implemented. Besides, a negative impact on the rejection of grid-voltage-induced harmonics is produced. To improve the control performance in the weak grid case, an adaptive control has been proposed. Adopting the estimated grid impedance, the signal for the grid-voltage feedforward is modified and the controller is adjusted with an adaptive rule to maintain a good phase margin or a high bandwidth. Performances of the inverter with the typical and the proposed methods are compared. Simulation and experimental results have demonstrated that the grid-connected LCL-filtered inverter with the proposed method produced a high-quality current while large grid impedance existed.},

The potential efficiency gains from the use of SiC devices in a wind gen-eration system are explored by simulations, with the system mod-eling explained in detail. The performance of the SiC converter is analyzed and compared to its silicon counterpart at different wind speeds, temperatures, and switching frequencies. The quantitative results are based on SiC metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) prototypes from Cree and modern Si in-sulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) products. A conclusion is drawn that the SiC converters can improve the wind system power conversion efficiency and can reduce the system's size and cost due to the low-loss, high-frequency, and high-temperature properties of SiC devices, even for one-for-one replacement for Si devices.

abstract = {The increasing installation of photovoltaic panels in low-voltage grids causes an over voltage problem, especially during high production and low consumption periods. Generally the over voltage problem is overcome by implementing reactive power control methods. The advances in networked control systems theory and practice create new scenarios where reactive power control methods can offer additional features and benefits. To explore these new capabilities, this study presents two new reactive power control methods that exploit the networked approach. These two methods are evaluated in a comparative reference framework that also includes the base-line case where no reactive control method is applied, the conventional droop method approach, and a solution based on a near-optimal location of a high power STATCOM derived from one of the new proposed networked methods. The main merit factors used to compare the control methods are the maximum voltage across the distribution grid, the power factor in the point of common coupling, and the total power losses and economic cost of the installation. With these merit factors, the advantages and limitations of the new and existing control methods are revealed and discussed. A useful discussion for selecting the best control solution is also reported.},

Using the modified design program, electrical designs of 10-MW synchronous WTGs with HTS coil, copper coil, and PM excitation are conducted, and the influence of machine parameters (such as magnetic flux density in rotor iron cores, pole pitch, and stator outer diameter) on the basic generator performance is clarified. Based on these results, the optimized designs of three kinds of WTGs rotating at the low speeds of 8 min(-1) and 10 min(-1) are performed, and their basic performance is studied.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Active power reserves are needed for the proper operation of an electrical system. These reserves are continuously regulated in order to match the generation and consumption in the system and thus, to maintain a constant electrical frequency. They are usually provided by synchronized conventional generating units such as hydraulic or thermal power plants. With the progressive displacement of these generating plants by non-synchronized renewable-based power plants (e.g. wind and solar) the net level of synchronous power reserves in the system becomes reduced. Therefore, wind power plants are required, according to some European Grid Codes, to also provide power reserves like conventional generating units do. This paper focuses not only on the review of the requirements set by Grid Codes, but also on control methods of wind turbines for their participation in primary frequency control and synthetic inertia.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {—Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) based de-tection of rotor cage faults (RFs) in medium-high voltage induction motors has become common in the field due to its low-cost remote monitoring capability. However, low-frequency load oscillations (LOs) in applications that employ speed reduction couplings can induce frequency components in the vicinity of that of RFs. It has been reported that false-positive or -negative RF indications can be produced with the MCSA, if the frequency components produced by RF and LO overlap. There, recently, have been studies on dis-criminating RF and LO; however, the case where two harmonic components overlap at the same frequency, which is the most dif-ficult and serious case, has not been investigated. In this paper, a spectrum analysis of instantaneous active and reactive power is applied, and it is shown that RF and LO can be separated for the case where the MCSA fails due to the overlap in the two spectral components. An experimental study performed on a 380 V motor with a speed reduction gear shows that RF and LO can be reliably detected and separated for avoiding false RF indications. Index Terms—Active power, belt pulley, coupling, electrical fault detection, fault diagnosis, gears, induction motors, load oscillation (LO), reactive power, rotor cage fault (RF), spectral analysis.},

Theoretically, all the techniques are quite effective for minimizing the cogging torque. This paper presents the efficacy of these methods in mass production subject to manufacturing tolerances/variations. The cogging torque minimization becomes a challenging task when the requirement is very stringent in applications such as electric power steering and robotics. Some of the known techniques for reducing the cogging torque are the magnet pole design, skewing, step skewing, and dummy slots in the stator lamination. They will be discussed in this paper considering manufacturing tolerances/variations when used in mass production. Finite-element analysis is carried out to determine the worst case scenarios. The research demonstrates that the cogging torque amplitude and frequency are highly sensitive to magnet shapes, dimensions, locations and magnetization pattern, as well as slot/pole combination. In reality, the cogging torque may not be eliminated completely but minimized to a satisfactory level depending on the application requirements.},

abstract = {Large-scale deployment of RES has led to significant generation shares of variable RES in power systems worldwide. RES units, notably inverter-connected wind turbines and PV that as such do not provide rotational inertia, are effectively displacing conventional generators and their rotating machinery. The traditional assumption that grid inertia is sufficiently high with only small variations over time is thus not valid for power systems with high RES shares. This has implications for frequency dynamics and power system stability and operation. Frequency dynamics are faster in power systems with low rotational inertia, making frequency control and power system operation more challenging.   This paper investigates the impact of low rotational inertia on power system stability and operation, contributes new analysis insights and offers impact mitigation options.},

The project started with the development of a new medium-caliber launcher (25 mm {\&}amp;times; 25 mm) named RAFIRA and a suitable loading system, as described in part I of the set of papers. This part II summarizes the major results obtained with RAFIRA in a single-shot mode and briefly explains the method of optimizing its performance. The experimental realization of the loading system described in part I is presented. First results regarding the performance of this loader are presented. Suitable conditions allowing multishot experiments were worked out. This paper concludes by presenting the first multishot experiments performed using the ISL armature technology. Already in the first tests, RAFIRA has accelerated projectiles up to more than 1000 m/s while achieving cadences around 30 Hz. The sliding contact performance of these experiments is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new method to enhance the participation of variable-speed wind energy conversion systems (WECS) in existing frequency regulation mechanisms. The proposed approach, based on a modified inertial control scheme, takes advantage of the fast response capability associated with electronically-controlled WECS, allowing the kinetic energy stored by rotational masses to be partly and transiently released in order to provide earlier frequency support. An additional improvement is achieved by communicating the WECS response to conventional generators so that these can eventually take care of the full load imbalance. Several simulations using a two-area test system are performed to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed scheme.},

@article{Gonzalez-Longatt,
abstract = {—Future power systems will be characterized by the massive deployment of high power converters for so many applications (e.g. FACTS, HVDC, energy storage systems, etc.). These devices imposes new challenges on the operation and control of power systems, especially in terms of frequency support. Power converters tend to naturally decouple the new power production units from the AC power grid, disabling natural frequency response. It is expected this situation decreases the total system inertia affecting the ability of power system to overcome system frequency's disturbances. Wind power industry has developed several controllers to provide inertial response on wind turbines generators (WTG) enabling the frequency response: e.g. Artificial, Emulated, Simulated, or Synthetic Inertia. However, there is a clear lack of knowledge about activation scheme used for these controllers and how they work in practical manner. This paper proposes three activation schemes for synthetic inertia controller on WTG based on full rated power converters (FRC): (i) continuously acting (ii) under-frequency trigger and (iii) maximum-frequency gradient trigger. Simulations considering a test system are used for evaluation of the proposed activation schemes. The main contribution of this paper is the definition activations schemes for the synthetic inertia controller and the practical simulations results demonstrating the under-frequency trigger provides the best dynamic response in term of system frequency response.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel methodology for comparing thermal energy storage to electrochemical, chemical, and mechanical energy storage technologies. The underlying physics of this model is hinged on the development of a round trip efficiency formulation for these systems. The charging and discharging processes of compressed air energy storage, flywheel energy storage, fuel cells, and batteries are well understood and defined from a physics standpoint in the context of comparing these systems. However, the challenge lays in comparing the charging process of these systems with the charging process of thermal energy storage systems for concentrating solar power plants (CSP). The round trip efficiency and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) are the metrics used for comparison purposes. The thermal energy storage system is specifically compared to vanadium redox, sodium sulphur, and compressed air energy storage (CAES) systems from a large scale storage perspective of 100's of MWh. The rationale behind this analysis was to develop an electrical storage efficiency for molten salt thermal energy storage systems, such that it can be compared to battery energy storage technologies in the context of comparing CSP with thermal energy storage to solar photovoltaic with battery storage from a utility scale perspective. The results from the modelling using Andasol 3 CSP plant as a case study yield a storage efficiency of 86{\%} and LCOE of {\$}216/MWh. The results of this modelling will facilitate the future generation of a thermal energy storage roadmap.},

With the superb switching performance of GaN power FETs, a reduction in IMMD size is achieved by eliminating inverter heat sink and optimizing dc-link capacitors. Gate signals of the IMMD modules are interleaved to suppress the total voltage ripple of dc-link capacitors and to further reduce the capacitor size. Motor winding configurations and their coupling effect are also investigated as a part of the IMMD design. The proposed structure and design methods are verified by experimental results.},

abstract = {— This paper presents a novel simplified cost effective binary based mechanism for eliminating problems in existing condition monitoring and diagnostic techniques. The existing techniques are engraved with problems like high cost of their implementation, failure to detect multiplicity of faults, complicated diagnosis system, expert knowledge, inherent ambiguities etc. The mechanism developed in this work gives flexibility to monitor faults at incipient stage and avoid catastrophic cascading of faults that leads to plant shutdown and consequent long repair/maintenance periods. The developed system detects working status of sensors, location of faults, no. of faults at that particular instant, acknowledgement of faults, and health status of electrical machines connected to the system. These diagnostic parameters have been extracted by implementing a simple logic circuitry. The main advantage of this system is that it can be applied to any rating of electrical machines. The input parameters for the system are the outputs of the sensors which are capable to measure variation in parameters like current, voltage, flux, torque, speed, temperature, and vibration etc. due to occurrence of faults. The test results of the proposed mechanism have been found to be highly encouraging, accurate and extremely fast providing the much needed protection of machines.

These efforts include fundamental research on materials, properties of materials subjected to electromagnetic and thermal stresses, railguns (particularly the rail-armature sliding interface), coilguns, and energy storage and power conditioning. There is also broad and growing interest in novel applications of electromagnetic launch. For example, a supersonic beam of neon atoms have been slowed and stopped, opening the door for investigating the atomic and molecular properties of most of the periodic table of atoms and certain molecules. Research is continuing on magnetic brakes and the more traditional research on the launch of materials to hypervelocities. More recently, the launching of materials into the Earth's orbit or even deeper in space is obtaining renewed interest. Consequently, some attention is being given to the types of materials of projectiles for hypersonic flight. The U.S. Navy has initiated new multidisciplinary university research teams including physics, chemistry, and materials science to develop new diagnostic tools and to provide a more detailed examination of the rail-armature interface. Most significantly, the U.S. Army has elevated its emphasis from electromagnetic launch science and technology development to the operational consequences of long-range precision fires. In concert with the recent U.S. Navy efforts on long-range fires, it is anticipated that the pull of these applications will enable even greater advances in the science and technology of electromagnetic launch.},

This part of the ripples can amount to a significant fraction of the overall ripple if the hysteresis bands are comparable to the maximum torque and flux variations in one sampling interval. This paper presents a prediction scheme with low computational complexity and low parameter sensitivity, both comparable to the standard DTC scheme. The prediction scheme can easily be extended to compensate for multiple time delays when the sampling frequency is raised but the computation time remains unchanged.

abstract = {Wind energy technology is evolving towards larger machines (longer blades, taller towers and more powerful generators). Scaling up wind turbines is a challenging task, which requires innovative solutions as well as new configurations and de- signs. The size of wind turbines (in terms of rotor diameter, hub height and rated power) has increased extraordinary from 30m rotor diameter, 30m of hub height and 300kW rated power, usual in the late 1980s, to 92.7m rotor diameter, 87.7m of height and 2.1MW on average at the end of 2014. However, technological evolution has not only been focused on the scaling up process but also on developing innovative solutions that minimize costs at the same time as they deal with as- pects of different nature, such as grid code requirements, reliability, quality of the wind resource or prices and availability of certain commodities, among others. This paper analyses the evolution of wind technology from a market-based perspective by identifying trends in the most relevant technological indicators at the same time as stressing the key differentiating aspects between regions/markets. Evo- lution and trends in indicators such as rated power, rotor diameter, hub height, specific power, wind class, drive train con- figuration and power control systems are presented and analysed, showing an intense and fast technological development, which is enabling wind energy to reduce costs and becoming increasingly more competitive with conventional fuel-based generating technologies. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors Wind Energy Published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {We present efficiency and scaling relationships for dc (i.e., noninduction) constant inductance gradient electromagnetic launchers.We derive expressions for electromagnetic force, efficiency, back-voltage, and kinetic power in terms of electrical circuit parameters. We show that launcher efficiency is a simple function of armature velocity and the launcher's characteristic velocity. The characteristic ve- locity characterizes the launcher and is the product of two new parameters: the mode constant and launcher constant. Mathematically, the launcher must operate at its characteristic velocity for 50{\%} maximum efficiency. The mode constant reflects the manner in which the launcher is powered and its maximum efficiency. The launcher constant reflects the geometry of the launcher.We consider two modes of operation: constant current and zero exit current operation.We develop the ideal electromagnetic launcher concept and define it as operation at 100{\%} maximum efficiency at all velocities.We also develop the concept of same-scale comparisons, that is, that electromag- netic launcher comparisons should be done with equal bore diameter, launcher length, projectile mass, and velocity. Finally, we present a comparative analysis based on experimental data of same-scale constant gradient electromagnetic launchers for conventional railgun, augmented railgun, and helical gun launchers in terms of the launcher constant, inductance gradient, bore diameter, bore length, system resistance, and armature (i.e., projectile) velocity.},

abstract = {Fractional-slot PM machines have several advantages, but they suffer from the high contents of space harmonics in the air-gap MMF distribution. The MMF space harmonic amplitude and frequency depend on the particular combination of number of slots and poles. Such harmonics induce losses in the rotor since they are not synchronous with the rotor speed. This paper compares two kind of machines with the same stator lamination but with different number of phases, a three phase and a five-phase PM machine. Several winding configurations are compared, changing the number of poles but maintaining the same number of slots. Although in each case there is a reduction in terms of harmonic contents, it is shown that rotor losses reduction is lower than expected. Some considerations about the harmonic impact are given.},

abstract = {The increasing application of nonlinear loads may cause distribution system power quality issues. In order to utilize distributed generation (DG) unit interfacing converters to actively compensate harmonics, this paper proposes an enhanced current control approach, which seamlessly integrates system harmonic mitigation capabilities with the primary DG power generation function. As the proposed current controller has two well-decoupled control branches to independently control fundamental and harmonic DG currents, local nonlinear load harmonic current detection and distribution system harmonic voltage detection are not necessary for the proposed harmonic compensation method. Moreover, a closed-loop power control scheme is employed to directly derive the fundamental current reference without using any phase-locked loops (PLL). The proposed power control scheme effectively eliminates the impacts of steady-state fundamental current tracking errors in the DG units. Thus, an accurate power control is realized even when the harmonic compensation functions are activated. In addition, this paper also briefly discusses the performance of the proposed method when DG unit is connected to a grid with frequency deviation. Simulated and experimental results from a single-phase DG unit validate the correctness of the proposed methods.},

The impedance of the LCL filter has a typical frequency characteristic with a resonance peak. Hence, the LCL filter has to be damped in order to avoid instability. However, the resonance of the LCL filter can be also excited in a controlled way in order to individuate the resonance frequency in the spectrum (using for example the fast Fourier transform). This paper proposes to use a controlled excitation in measuring the grid impedance, since this one influences also the resonance frequency. This paper will address some possible limits, some solutions, and some implementation issues (e.g., how to obtain a controlled resonance in the filter without damaging the system) in order to use the resonant peak for grid impedance detection. The analysis is validated both by simulations and experimental results.},

The goal of the control is to have the BESS to provide as much smoothing as possible, so that the wind farm can be dispatched on an hourly basis based on the forecasted wind conditions. The effectiveness of this control strategy has been tested by using an actual wind farm data. Furthermore, a real-time implementation strategy using model predictive control is also proposed. Finally, it is shown that the control strategy is very important in improving the BESS performance for this application.},

The Wind Turbine Emulator (WTE) consists of two coupled 1.5 kW squirrel-cage induction machines. The WTE calculations are performed on a PC and a DSP, both connected via USB. The total torque applied to the WTE motor is the difference of the scaled wind mechanical torque calculated on the PC, and the turbine inertia torque calculated on the DSP. An improved WTE shaft speed derivative has been used for the inertia torque calculation, which provides better results in terms of attenuation of the high-frequency harmonics present in the generator speed acquisition. The implemented WTE is used to compare different MPPT algorithms and to test power overrating and low voltage ride through procedures.},

At the grid fault condition, the DC-link voltage controller is designed using a feedback linearization (FL) theory. For the MPPT, a proportional control loop is added to the torque control to reduce the influence of the inertia moment in the wind turbines, which can improve its dynamic performance.

abstract = {A novel procedure for estimating the total inertia of the Great Britain (GB) power system is presented. Following an instantaneous in-feed loss, regional variations in the estimate of inertia are obtained from measured frequency transients using installed synchronised phasor measurement units (PMUs). A method is proposed to first detect a suitable event for analysis, and then filter the measured transients in order to obtain a reliable estimate of inertia for a given region of the GB network. The total inertia for the whole system is then calculated as a summation, with an estimate also provided as to the contribution to inertia from residual sources, namely synchronously connected demand and embedded generation. The approach is first demonstrated on the full dynamic model of the GB transmission system, before results are presented from analyzing the impact of a number of instantaneous transmission in-feed loss events using phase-angle data provided by PMUs from the GB transmission network and also devices installed at the domestic supply at 4 GB universities.},

A polynomial approximation with respect to time is applied to the waveform of the transients in estimating the inertia constant, and a simple model based on the idea of average system frequency is assumed in estimating the capacity of the generators. Results of the estimation using the transients at 10 events show that the inertia constant of the 60 Hz power system of Japan is around 14 to 18 seconds in the system load base, and the capacity of the spinning-reserve support generators is 20 to 40{\%} of the system load. The proposed procedure is expected to be tested by Kansai Electric Power Company with increased number of events.

@article{Yuan2009,
abstract = {When the wind power accounts for a large portion of the grid power, it may need to help the grid voltage and frequency regulation. This paper investigates a permanent-magnet wind generator with a full power voltage-source converter in weak-grid mode, where the DC-link voltage needs to be controlled from the generator side instead of the grid side. The energy relationship of the wind generator, DC-link energy storage, and load is established. An intrinsic right-half-plane zero, together with the wind power characteristics, the mechanical system inertia, and the DC-link energy storage, is identified as the physical limitations for the control. With the understanding of the system energy relationship and limitations, a hybrid adaptive control algorithm is proposed that searches for the optimal generator acceleration to achieve the maximum wind generator power change rate to match the load power variation. The proposed control scheme is verified through simulation of a 1.5-MW wind system as well as through the experiment of a scaled 1-kW, DSP-/field-programmable-gate-array-controlled, permanent-magnet-generator-based test bed. The results show that it is feasible to regulate DC link by the generator-side converter through the generator speed control. Some important applications issues are also investigated, including the DC-link energy storage requirement, wind speed change impact, and control transition between the weak-grid and strong-grid modes.},

An additional improvement is achieved by communicating the WECS response to conventional generators so that these can eventually take care of the full load imbalance.

@article{Diaz2009,
abstract = {In this paper, the sensorless control of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) for wind turbine applications is presented. This kind of generator has many advantages, such as: high efficiency, high power density and low maintenance requirements. To improve these characteristics in the whole wind generator system a sensorless scheme is proposed, thereby avoiding problems of electromagnetic interferences and failures in the position sensor. Usually, in wind drive system, the generator is not operated a very low speeds, therefore problems related to low back-emf for flux estimation in sensorless strategies are avoided. The sensorless scheme proposed here is based on a synchronous d-q frame phase- locked loop (PLL) for back-emf estimation, as those used in voltage phase detection for grid connected converters. The wind turbine control includes maximum power point tracking (MPPT) using the method usually referred in the literature as indirect speed control (ISC). The principle of this method is the regulation of the generator torque as function of rotor speed such that the steady state operation is at the MPPT. This strategy normally requires the knowledge of the shaft speed to determinate the reference torque and rotor position for the orientation of the vector torque control of the PMSG. To achieve both, speed and position estimation, the sensorless technique based in back-emf estimation is proposed. Also in this paper, a laboratory set-up is described. The experimental bench is composed by a squirrel cage induction machine used as wind turbine emulator and the permanent magnet generator. A control program uses a simulated wind profile and gives the speed reference for the induction machine drive, considering the turbine torque production and the inertia of the system. Experimental results to verify the sensorless MPPT of the PMSG are obtained using this wind turbine emulator.},

abstract = {Galvanic isolation in grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) microinverters is a very important feature concerning power quality and safety issues. However, high-frequency transformers and high switching losses degrade the efficiency of the isolated types of microinverters. Recently, several isolated topologies were proposed to increase the efficiency and lifetime of PV converters. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the most recent isolated topologies of PV microinverters. These topologies are categorized into two groups in terms of their power processing stages: 1) single-stage microinverter and 2) multi-stage microinverter. Various topologies are presented, compared, and scrutinized in terms of the power losses at different stages, control techniques, position of the decoupling capacitor, and cost analysis. Recommendations are provided to improve the existing topologies and select the suitable control techniques to obtain a clear picture of the framework for next-generation isolated PV microinverters.},

abstract = {The continued growth and expansion of the wind power industry in the face of a global recession and a financial crisis is a testament to the inherent attractiveness of the technology. Wind power is clean, reliable, and quick to install; it's the leading electricity generation technology in the fight against climate change, enhancing energy security, stabilising electricity prices, cleaning up our air and creating thousands of quality jobs in the manufacturing sector when they're particularly hard to come by. Early 2009, when we published our last set of five year projections, was the absolute low point of the financial crisis. Capital was largely unavailable in most OECD countries, and bankers and consultancies were all predicting a dramatic drop in the renewable energy sector in general and in wind power in particular. GWEC's prediction of 12{\%} growth in the wind sector was generally greeted with disbelief and derision, figuring we were just trying to put a brave face on disaster.},

abstract = {In 2014, the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy reached 16.0{\%} in the European Union (EU), almost double that of 2004 (8.5{\%}), the first year for which the data is available. The share of renewables in gross final consumption of energy is one of the headline indicators of the Europe 2020 strategy. The target to be reached by 2020 for the EU is a share of 20{\%} energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy. However, renewables will continue to play a key role in helping the EU meet its energy needs beyond 2020. For this reason, Member States have already agreed on a new EU renewable energy target of at least 27{\%} by 2030. Since 2004, the share of renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy grew significantly in all Member States. Compared with a year ago, it has increased in 24 of the 28 Member States. With more than half (52.6{\%}) of energy from renewable sources in its gross final consumption of energy, Sweden had by far in 2014 the highest share, ahead of Latvia and Finland (both 38.7{\%}), Austria (33.1{\%}) and Denmark (29.2{\%}). At the opposite end of the scale, the lowest proportions of renewables were registered in Luxembourg (4.5{\%}), Malta (4.7{\%}), the Netherlands (5.5{\%}) and the United Kingdom (7.0{\%}).},
