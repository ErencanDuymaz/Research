abstract = {In electrical islands, frequency excursions are sizeable and automatic load shedding is often required in response to disturbances. Moreover, the displacement of conventional generation with wind and solar plants, which usually do not provide inertial response, further weakens these power systems. Fast-acting storage, by injecting power within instants after the loss of a generating unit, can back up conventional generation assets during the activation of their primary reserve. This paper relies on dynamic simulations to study the provision of such a dynamic frequency control support by energy storage systems in the French island of Guadeloupe with large shares of wind or solar generation. The results show that fast-acting storage, by acting as a synthetic inertia, can mitigate the impact of these sources on the dynamic performance of the studied island grid in the case of a major generation outage. The other concerns raised by renewables (e.g., variability, forecast accuracy, low voltage ride-through, etc.) have not been addressed within this project.},

abstract = {MANY BELIEVE THE ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEM IS UNDERGOING A PROFOUND change driven by a number of needs. There's the need for environmental compliance and energy conservation. We need better grid reliability while dealing with an aging infrastructure. And we need improved operational effi ciencies and customer service. The changes that are happening are particularly signifi cant for the electricity distribution grid, where “blind” and manual operations, along with the electromechanical components, will need to be transformed into a “smart grid.” This transformation will be necessary to meet environmental targets, to accommodate a greater emphasis on demand response (DR), and to support plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as well as distributed generation and storage capabilities. It is safe to say that these needs and changes present the power industry with the biggest challenge it has ever faced. On one hand, the transition to a smart grid has to be evolutionary to keep the lights on; on the other hand, the issues surrounding the smart grid are signifi cant enough to demand major changes in power systems operating philosophy.},

abstract = {Galvanic isolation in grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) microinverters is a very important feature concerning power quality and safety issues. However, high-frequency transformers and high switching losses degrade the efficiency of the isolated types of microinverters. Recently, several isolated topologies were proposed to increase the efficiency and lifetime of PV converters. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the most recent isolated topologies of PV microinverters. These topologies are categorized into two groups in terms of their power processing stages: 1) single-stage microinverter and 2) multi-stage microinverter. Various topologies are presented, compared, and scrutinized in terms of the power losses at different stages, control techniques, position of the decoupling capacitor, and cost analysis. Recommendations are provided to improve the existing topologies and select the suitable control techniques to obtain a clear picture of the framework for next-generation isolated PV microinverters.},

abstract = {At the end of 2016, global renewable generation capacity amounted to 2,006 GW.* Hydro accounted for the largest share of the global total, with an installed capacity of 1,122 GW. Three-quarters of this was in large-scale plants of over 10 MW. Wind and solar energy accounted for most of the remainder, with capacities of 467 GW and 296 GW respectively. Other renewables included 110 GW of bioenergy, 13 GW of geothermal energy and about 500 MW of marine energy (tide, wave and ocean). Capacity growth Similar to last year, renewable generation capacity increased by 161 GW or +8.7{\%} during 2016, continuing the trend since 2009 of about 8-9{\%} annual capacity growth. Solar energy took first place, with a capacity increase of 71 GW (+32{\%}), followed by wind energy with an increase of 51 GW (+12{\%}). Hydropower and bioenergy capacities increased by 30 GW (+3{\%}) and 9 GW (+9{\%}) respectively. Geothermal energy increased by just under 1 GW. Renewable capacity expansion continues to be driven mostly by new installations of solar and wind energy, although 2016 was the best ever year for growth in bioenergy generating capacity.},

abstract = {The present work is based on developing a control strategy to mitigate the impact of reduced inertia due to significant DFIG penetration in a large power system. The paper aims to design a supplementary control for the DFIG power converters such that the effective inertia contributed by these wind generators to the system is increased. The paper also proposes the idea of adjusting pitch compensation and maximum active power order to the converter in order to improve inertial response during the transient with response to drop in grid frequency. Results obtained on a large realistic power system indicate that the frequency nadir following a large power impact in the form of generators dropping out is effectively improved with the proposed control strategy. The proposed control is also validated against the sudden wind speed change in the form of wind gust downs and wind ramp downs occurring in conjunction with the generators dropping out. A beneficial impact in terms of damping power system oscillations is also observed, which is validated by eigenvalue analysis. The affected mode is then excited with a large disturbance in time domain. The damping improvement observed in time domain and subsequent Prony analysis support the result obtained from eigenvalue analysis.},

The share of renewables in gross final consumption of energy is one of the headline indicators of the Europe 2020 strategy. The target to be reached by 2020 for the EU is a share of 20{\%} energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy. However, renewables will continue to play a key role in helping the EU meet its energy needs beyond 2020. For this reason, Member States have already agreed on a new EU renewable energy target of at least 27{\%} by 2030. Since 2004, the share of renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy grew significantly in all Member States. Compared with a year ago, it has increased in 24 of the 28 Member States. With more than half (52.6{\%}) of energy from renewable sources in its gross final consumption of energy, Sweden had by far in 2014 the highest share, ahead of Latvia and Finland (both 38.7{\%}), Austria (33.1{\%}) and Denmark (29.2{\%}). At the opposite end of the scale, the lowest proportions of renewables were registered in Luxembourg (4.5{\%}), Malta (4.7{\%}), the Netherlands (5.5{\%}) and the United Kingdom (7.0{\%}).},

abstract = {An interconnected electric power system is a complex system that must be operated within a safe frequency range in order to reliably maintain the instantaneous balance between generation and load. This is accomplished by ensuring that adequate resources are available to respond to expected and unexpected imbalances and restoring frequency to its scheduled value in order to ensure uninterrupted electric service to customers. Electrical systems must be flexible enough to reliably operate under a variety of "change" scenarios. System planners and operators must understand how other parts of the system change in response to the initial change, and need tools to manage such changes to ensure reliable operation within the scheduled frequency range. This report presents a systematic approach to identifying metrics that are useful for operating and planning a reliable system with increased amounts of variable renewable generation which builds on existing industry practices for frequency control after unexpected loss of a large amount of generation. The report introduces a set of metrics or tools for measuring the adequacy of frequency response within an interconnection. Based on the concept of the frequency nadir, these metrics take advantage of new information gathering and processing capabilities that system operators are developing for wide-area situational awareness. Primary frequency response is the leading metric that will be used by this report to assess the adequacy of primary frequency control reserves necessary to ensure reliable operation. It measures what is needed to arrest frequency decline (i.e., to establish frequency nadir) at a frequency higher than the highest set point for under- frequency load shedding within an interconnection. These metrics can be used to guide the reliable operation of an interconnection under changing circumstances.},

Wind power is clean, reliable, and quick to install; it's the leading electricity generation technology in the fight against climate change, enhancing energy security, stabilising electricity prices, cleaning up our air and creating thousands of quality jobs in the manufacturing sector when they're particularly hard to come by. Early 2009, when we published our last set of five year projections, was the absolute low point of the financial crisis. Capital was largely unavailable in most OECD countries, and bankers and consultancies were all predicting a dramatic drop in the renewable energy sector in general and in wind power in particular. GWEC's prediction of 12{\%} growth in the wind sector was generally greeted with disbelief and derision, figuring we were just trying to put a brave face on disaster.},

abstract = {At a high level, the report concludes that as an electric system approaches a significant penetration in variable resources: Essential reliability services will be strained; Technical aspects of the evolving resource mix must be given due consideration at state, federal, and provincial levels; Solution sets for maintaining reliability can come from: Market tools and rules, New technology integration, and Standards or requirements; and Unresolved cost implications can impede solution sets. In summary, NERC recommends the following: NERC, state and provincial regulators, and industry should use an analytical basis for understanding potential reliability impacts as a result of increasing VERs and how those impacts can affect system configuration, composition, and essential reliability services. Based on analytical results and the broad experience of NERC stakeholders, specific recommendations for changes to operating and planning practices, state and provincial programs, and pertinent NERC Reliability Standards should be developed. Specific recommendations to date are provided in the NERC IVGTF reports listed in Appendix 2. VER issues can be addressed through many non-NERC avenues (e.g., market rules; vertically integrated operations; or federal, state, and provincial programs). However, it is recommended that NERC work with affected entities in the different NERC Regions, including state and provincial agencies that have jurisdiction over VERs, wholesale market areas, and vertically integrated utilities, to develop appropriate guidelines, practices, and requirements to address VER integration issues that impact the reliability of the BPS. CAISO recommendations are included throughout the report and are specific to the CAISO area. While these recommendations represent good industry practice in meeting reliability objectives, consideration of region-specific issues and tailored approaches will likely be needed as other areas observe increasing VER trends. Specific items for consideration include: Reactive power control Active power control Inertia and Frequency Response Steady-State, Short-Circuit, and Dynamic Generic Model Development},

abstract = {This paper describes a design of grid-simulator for an experiment of transient stability of grid-connected renewable energy system. A transient analysis of renewable energy system has been researched by a simulation, because a direct connection of renewable energy system to the real utility under transient grid conditions is dangerous and it is hard to produce the transient grid conditions with direct grid connection. If a grid-simulator is used in the transient stability experiment, the transient grid condition might be generated easily using reference data without any impact on the grid. A back-to-back converter was employed as a grid-simulator. The grid-simulator was designed by simulation with PSCAD/EMTDC. In order to confirm its physical operational characteristics, the grid-simulator was manufactured and its experiment results showed that the grid-simulator could generate transient grid conditions without any influence to the grid.},

abstract = {In this study, a grid simulator based on a back-to-back inverter topology with resonant controllers is presented. The simulator is able to generate three-phase voltages for a range of amplitudes and frequencies with different types of perturbations, such as voltage sags, steady-state unbalanced voltages, low-order harmonics and flicker. The aim of this equipment is to test the performance of a given system under such distorted voltages. A prototype of the simulator, consisting of two inverters connected back-to-back to a 380 V three-phase grid and feeding a micro-grid composed of two-inverter interfaced distributed generators and a critical load was built and tested. A set of experimental results for linear purely resistive loads, non-linear loads and current-controlled inverters is presented to prove the capabilities of the simulator. Finally, a case study is presented by testing a micro-grid. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {The increasing penetration of wind power impacts the frequency stability of power systems. A doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind power plant naturally does not provide frequency response because of the decoupling between the output power and the grid frequency. DFIGs also lack power reserve margin because of the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) operation. Therefore this study presents a novel frequency regulation by DFIG-based wind turbines to coordinate inertial control, rotor speed control and pitch angle control, under low, medium or high wind speed mode. Inertial control emulates the inertia of wind generators and supports frequency control during transient. The gain of inertial control is calculated from a creative viewpoint of protecting the wind turbine from stalling. Rotor speed control and pitch angle control enable DFIGs to reserve sufficient active power for a steady-state frequency adjustment. The numerical simulations demonstrate that the coordinated control enhances the frequency regulation capability and damps the frequency oscillations effectively.},

abstract = {High wind energy penetration levels in modern power systems draw attention towards wind farms expected role during frequency drops. Wind farms positive contribution required by system operators basically depends on the amount of kinetic energy stored in wind turbines rotating parts and how to manage it during frequency deviations elimination. This study presents an algorithm to estimate and control the quantity of extractable kinetic energy stored in a wind farm during frequency drops. Moreover, it manages stored kinetic energy release within a given time span to achieve positive participation in frequency drops clearance. The proposed method is based on tuning the tip speed ratio before and during the frequency drop according to several factors. The recovery time required by the wind turbine to retain its normal speed is also a function of several parameters including turbine inertia and the incoming wind speed. The proposed algorithm's impact on power system frequency is analysed by assessing the expected enhancement in frequency deviation. A hypothetical grid is considered as the benchmark including detailed modelling for wind speeds, wind turbine and wind farm to improve the creditability of the obtained results. Presented research work outcomes highlight the impact of wind farms replacement for conventional generators. Executed simulations proved that applying the proposed algorithm neutralises wind energy penetration influence on system frequency response, even more, it causes solid improvements unless the incident wind speed is too slow or the frequency drop is too high. Simulation environments are MATLAB and Simulink.},

The SST consists of a cascaded multilevel ac/dc rectifier stage, a dual active bridge (DAB) converter stage with high-frequency transformers to provide a regulated 400-V dc distribution, and an optional dc/ac stage that can be connected to the 400-V dc bus to provide residential 120/240 V {\_}{\{}rm ac{\}}. However, due to dc-link voltage and power unbalance in the cascaded modules, the unbalanced dc-link voltages and power increase the stress of the semiconductor devices and cause overvoltage or overcurrent issues. This paper proposes a new voltage and power balance control for the cascaded H-Bridge converter-based SST. Based on the single-phase dq model, a novel voltage and the power control strategy is proposed to balance the rectifier capacitor voltages and the real power through parallel DAB modules. Furthermore, the intrinsic power constraints of the cascaded H-Bridge voltage balance control are derived and analyzed. With the proposed control methods, the dc-link voltage and the real power through each module can be balanced. The SST switching model simulation and the prototype experiments are presented to verify the performance of the proposed voltage and power balance controller.},

However, this approach requires long sampling and computation periods. In this study, a novel speed and position estimation method, based on identification of rotor slot harmonics that does not require any kind of spectral analysis is proposed. The required information is extracted by demodulating the information available in an external search coil (or in phase current). The algorithm used for this purpose is fast and can be applied within a typical control cycle of a vector controlled drive algorithm. In the application of the method here, higher order rotor slot harmonics have been utilized. In this manner, the position estimation resolution increases and also possible effect of harmonics stemming from other sources are avoided. The approach is explained in the paper and illustrated with experimental results.},

The MC-SST system presents single-stage ac-ac conversion, reduced transformer volume and weight compared to using the conventional line-frequency transformer, and smart transmission capability due to the controllable voltage amplitude and frequency. However, the existing modulation methods contain sophisticated voltage and current vectors computation and duty cycle composition, which could make the control of the proposed topology too complex. In this paper, it is decided to use easy to perform MPC for the whole scheme. The proposed MPC predicts the circuit variables based on the discrete model of MC-SST system, and evaluates a cost function that ensures closest value to the current reference of ac outputs. The best switching state is selected to drive the power devices in the next sampling period. Simulation studies carried out on different voltage amplitude and frequency between ac inputs and outputs, as well as load power variations demonstrated the effectiveness and simplicity of the proposed MPC for the MC-SST.},

abstract = {The solid-state transformer (SST) is one of the key elements in power electronic-based microgrid systems. The single-phase SST consists of a modular multilevel ac{\&}{\#}x2013;dc rectifier, a modular dual active bridge (DAB) dc{\&}{\#}x2013;dc converter with high-frequency transformers, and a dc{\&}{\#}x2013;ac inverter stage. However, due to dc bus voltage and power unbalancing in each module, the modular SST often presents instability problems making its design difficult and causing unpredictable behavior. Moreover, the unbalanced dc-link voltages increase the stress of the semiconductor devices, and also cause high harmonic distortions of grid current, therefore, necessitating the use of a bigger ac filter. This paper presents a novel single-phase d{\&}{\#}x2013;q vector-based common-duty-ratio control method for the multilevel rectifier, and a voltage feedforward and feedback based controller for the modular DAB converter. With the proposed control methods, the dc-link voltage and power in each module can be balanced. In addition, the low-distortion grid current, unity power factor, and bidirectional power flow can be achieved. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed control methods.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design of new high-frequency transformer isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter modules connected in input-series-output-parallel (ISOP) for 20-kVA-solid-state transformer. The ISOP modular structure enables the use of low-voltage MOSFETs, featuring low on-state resistance and resulted conduction losses, to address medium-voltage input. A phase-shift dual-half-bridge (DHB) converter is employed to achieve high-frequency galvanic isolation, bidirectional power flow, and zero voltage switching (ZVS) of all switching devices, which leads to low switching losses even with high-frequency operation. Furthermore, an adaptive inductor is proposed as the main energy transfer element of a phase-shift DHB converter so that the circulating energy can be optimized to maintain ZVS at light load and minimize the conduction losses at heavy load as well. As a result, high efficiency over wide load range and high power density can be achieved. In addition, current stress of switching devices can be reduced. A planar transformer adopting printed-circuit-board windings arranged in an interleaved structure is designed to obtain low core and winding loss, solid isolation, and identical parameters in multiple modules. Moreover, the modular structure along with a distributed control provides plug-and-play capability and possible high-level fault tolerance. The experimental results on 1 kW DHB converter modules switching at 50 kHz are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.},

First, the analytical model of a multibrid wind turbine concept consisting of a single-stage gearbox and a three-phase radial-flux PM synchronous generator with a back-to-back power converter is presented. The design optimization is adopted with a genetic algorithm for minimizing generator system cost. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed electromagnetic design model, the optimization results of a 500-kW direct-drive PM generator and a 1.5-MW multibrid PM generator with various gear ratios are, respectively, compared with those from other methods. Then, the optimal design approach is further employed for a range from 750 kW up to 10 MW. The optimization results of PM generator systems including direct-drive and multibrid wind turbine configurations are obtained, and the suitable ranges of gear ratios for different power ratings are investigated. Finally, the detailed comparisons of the most cost-effective multibrid PM generator system and the optimized direct-drive PM generator system are also presented and discussed. The comparative results have shown that the multibrid wind turbine concept appears more cost-effective than the direct-drive concept.},

The optimized power point tracking (OPPT) controller, which shifts the turbine operating point from the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) curve to the virtual inertia control (VIC) curves according to the frequency deviation, is proposed to release the “hidden” kinetic energy and provide dynamic frequency support to the grid. The effects of the VIC on power oscillation damping capability are theoretically evaluated. Compared to the conventional supplementary derivative regulator-based inertia control, the proposed control scheme can not only provide fast inertial response, but also increase the system damping capability during transient events. Thus, inertial response and power oscillation damping function can be obtained in a single controller by the proposed OPPT control. A prototype three-machine system containing two synchronous generators and a PMSG-based wind turbine with 31{\%} of wind penetration is tested to validate the proposed control strategy on providing rapid inertial response and enhanced system damping.},

abstract = {Several smart grid applications have recently been devised in order to timely perform supervisory functions along with self-healing and adaptive countermeasures based on system-wide analysis, with the ultimate goal of reducing the risks associated with potentially insecure operating conditions. Real-time transient stability assessment (TSA) belongs to this type of applications, which allows deciding and coordinating pertinent corrective control actions depending on the evolution of post-fault rotor-angle deviations. This study presents a novel approach for carrying out real-time TSA based on prediction of area-based centre-of-inertia (COI) referred rotor angles from phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements. Monte Carlo-based procedures are performed to iteratively evaluate the system transient stability response, considering the operational statistics related to loading condition changes and fault occurrence rates, in order to build a knowledge database for PMU and COI-referred rotor-angles as well as to screen those relevant PMU signals that allows ensuring high observability of slow and fast dynamic phenomena. The database is employed for structuring and training an intelligent COI-referred rotor-angle regressor based on support vector machines [support vector regressor (SVR)] to be used for real-time TSA from selected PMUs. Besides, the SVR is optimally tuned by using the swarm variant of the mean-variance mapping optimisation. The proposal is tested on the IEEE New England 39-bus system. Results demonstrate the feasibility of the methodology in estimating the COI-referred rotor angles, which enables alerting about real-time transient stability threats per system areas, for which a transient stability index is also computed.},

The results of this study have shown that the present preferred method of solidly bonding primary and secondary neutrals is consistent with the goal of minimizing primary neutral-to-earth voltage on rural feeders. The large amounts of supplemental primary neutral grounding, load balancing, and line reconstruction accomplished during this investigation could not reduce the primary neutral-to-earth voltage to zero.

abstract = {This paper presents a coordinated voltage control scheme (CVCS) for a cluster of offshore wind power plants (OWPPs) connected to a VSC HVDC system. The primary control point of the proposed voltage control scheme is the introduced Pilot bus, which is having the highest short circuit capacity in the offshore AC grid. The developed CVCS comprehends an optimization algorithm, aiming for minimum active power losses in the offshore grid, to generate voltage reference to the Pilot bus. During steady state operation, the Pilot bus voltage is controlled by dispatching reactive power references to each wind turbine (WT) in the WPP cluster based on their available reactive power margin and network sensitivity based participation factors, which are derived from the dV/dQ sensitivity of a WT bus w.r.t the Pilot bus. This method leads to minimization of the risk of undesired effects, particularly overvoltage at the terminals of the WT located far away from the AC collector substation, by dispatching lower reactive power references compared to the ones nearer to the substation. In addition, the paper proposes a control strategy for improved voltage ride through capability of WTs for faults in the offshore grid, thus leading to improved dynamic voltage profile in the offshore AC grid.},

abstract = {Wind power is still the most promising renewable energy in the year of 2013. The wind turbine system (WTS) started with a few tens of kilowatt power in the 1980s. Now, multimegawatt wind turbines are widely installed even up to 6-8 MW. There is a widespread use of wind turbines in the distribution networks and more and more wind power stations, acting as power plants, are connected directly to the transmission networks. As the grid penetration and power level of the wind turbines increase steadily, the wind power starts to have significant impacts to the power grid system. Therefore, more advanced generators, power electronic systems, and control solutions have to be introduced to improve the characteristics of the wind power plant and make it more suitable to be integrated into the power grid. Meanwhile, there are also some emerging technology challenges, which need to be further clarified and investigated. This paper gives an overview and discusses some development trends in the technologies used for wind power systems. First, the developments of technology and market are generally discussed. Next, several state-of-the-art wind turbine concepts, as well as the corresponding power electronic converters and control structures, are reviewed, respectively. Furthermore, grid requirements and the technology challenges for the future WTS are also addressed.},

abstract = {For offshore wind energy, there is a trend toward larger wind turbines. The increased mass of a power-takeoff system increases the installation cost of the turbine. Direct-drive superconducting generators have the potential to reduce the installation cost of wind turbines. For a successful entry to the offshore-wind-energy market, a high-temperature superconducting generator should be as reliable as conventional generators. It is proposed that a stationary superconducting direct-current-field winding may increase the reliability of the generator. An axial-flux homopolar generator topology is proposed to be used in low-speed high-torque applications. The topology is modified by using two superconducting field windings to obtain a bipolar flux-density distribution for higher power density. Different core types and dimensions were examined to find the most suitable design, and a conceptual design of a 6-MW 12-r/min generator is presented.},

abstract = {The increasing prevalence of renewable and intermittent energy sources in the electricity system is creating new challenges for the interaction of the system. In Denmark, high renewable shares have been achieved without great difficulty, mainly due to the flexibility of the nearby Nordic hydro-power dominated system. Further increases in the share of renewable energy sources require that additional options are considered to facilitate integration with the lowest possible cost. With large shares of intermittent energy, the impact can be observed on wholesale prices, giving both lower prices and higher volatility. A lack of wind that causes high prices is rarely seen because long periods without wind are uncommon. Therefore we focus on the low price effects and the increased value of flexible demand options. On the supply side, there is an increase in the value of other flexible generation technologies and the attractiveness of additional interconnection capacity. This paper also analyses options for increasing the flexibility of heat generation involving large and decentralized CHP plants and heat generation based on electricity. The incentives that the market provides for shifting demand and using electricity for heat production are discussed based on the variability of prices observed from 2006 to 2008. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

This is also the case even when the load is of dc type, such as the typical portable electronic devices that require AC adaptors to be powered from the AC mains. The letter presents a hybrid PV-battery-powered dc bus system that eliminates the DC-AC conversion stage, resulting in lower cost and improved overall energy conversion efficiency. It is also shown experimentally that the switching ac adaptors associated with the various commonly used portable electronic devices can be reused with the proposed dc bus system. A novel high-gain hybrid boost-flyback converter is also introduced with several times higher voltage conversion ratio than the conventional boost converter topology. This arrangement results in higher DC bus levels and lower cable conduction losses. Moreover, the voltage stress on the hybrid boost-flyback converter power switch is within half the output voltage. Experimental results taken from a laboratory prototype are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed converter/system.},

In this paper, we propose using multiple modes of communication, including communication via wired, wireless and/or biological channels (bio-channels) of the human body, to network the various sensors, i.e. the idea of hybrid body sensor network (h-BSN).

To create the model, we obtained some broad design information from the published documents of turbine manufacturers, with a heavy emphasis on the REpower 5M machine. Because detailed data was unavailable, however, we also used the publicly available properties from the conceptual models in the WindPACT, RECOFF, and DOWEC projects. We then created a composite from these data, extracting the best available and most representative specifications. This report documents the specifications of the NREL offshore 5-MW baseline wind turbine—including the aerodynamic, structural, and control-system properties—and the rationale behind its development. The model has been, and will likely continue to be, used as a reference by research teams throughout the world to standardize baseline offshore wind turbine specifications and to quantify the benefits of advanced land- and sea-based wind energy technologies.},

abstract = {A concept is presented along with the overarching structure of the virtual power plant (VPP), the primary vehicle for delivering cost efficient integration of distributed energy resources (DER) into the existing power systems. The growing pressure, primarily driven by environmental concerns, for generating more electricity from renewables and improving energy efficiency have promoted the application of DER into electricity systems. So far, DER have been used to displace energy from conventional generating plants but not to displace their capacity as they are not visible to system operators. If this continues, this will lead to problematic over-capacity issues and under- utilisation of the assets, reduce overall system efficiency and eventually increase the electricity cost that needs to be paid by society. The concept of VPP was developed to enhance the visibility and control of DER to system operators and other market actors by providing an appropriate interface between these system components. The technical and commercial functionality facilitated through the VPP are described and concludes with case studies demonstrating the benefit of aggregation (VPP concept) and the use of the optimal power flow algorithm to characterise VPP.},

abstract = {This paper presents observations of real time frequency transients of
Bangladesh Power System (BPS) including last country-wide blackout on
1st November, 2014 after HVDC station tripped with respect to frequency
control and primary focus on Inertial Frequency Response. The inertia
constant of a system describes the initial, transient, frequency
behavior of a system when subjected to a real power disturbance.
Therefore, the inertia constant of a system can be a useful tool when
investigating the frequency stability of a system. The frequency
transients of power system is a significant index for power system
operation and research on the dynamic frequency characteristic of power
system is the basis of many important design works such as the design of
under frequency load shedding scheme. Therefore, it is of great urgency
and necessity to analysis the dynamic frequency characteristic of BPS
before countrywide blackout after disturbance. This paper first analysis
two real time frequency transients those have almost similar
predisturbance network condition and secondly shows that maintaining
minimum level of Inertial reserve in real-time operations with unit
commitment can be crucial to ensure stable, secure and reliable
operation of BPS. Beside this under frequency scheme should be revised
and controlled BPS network disintegration along with rate of change of
frequency should be adopted for adaptive as well as self-healing of BPS.
This paper also focus on adaptive central under frequency and under
voltage load shed scheme (UFVLS) rather than discrete under frequency
load shed (UFLS).},

abstract = {In order to achieve maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for wind power generation systems, the rotating speed of wind turbines should be adjusted in the real time according to wind speeds. However, fast wind speed variations and heavy inertia compromise the MPPT control of a wind turbine. In this paper, a fuzzy-logic based MPPT strategy is proposed for PMSG variable speed wind turbine generation systems. The proposed MPPT strategy adopts a hill climbing searching (HCS) method, and thus is independent of the turbine and generator characteristics. The MPPT strategy locates the system operation points along the maximum power curves based on the inverter dc-link voltage, thus avoiding the generator speed detection. Two control loops are designed for the MPPT control. Both simulation and field tests have been conducted to validate the performance of the proposed MPPT strategy, and all results have verified the effectiveness of the MPPT strategy.},

@article{Morren2006a,
abstract = {The increasing penetration of variable speed wind turbines in the electricity grid will result in a reduction of the number of connected conventional power plants. This will lead to a reduction of inertia in the grid, as the rotational speed of a variable speed turbine and the grid are decoupled by a power electronic converter. A lower system inertia will result in larger and faster frequency deviations after occurrence of abrupt variations in generation and load. It is possible to implement an additional control loop in the power electronic converter of the turbine, which connects the turbine inertia directly to the grid. It is even possible, by control, to make a 'virtual inertia' that is larger than the real inertia. During a frequency drop additional power can be released to the grid with this control. This behaviour will be called inertial response. The additional power is obtained from the kinetic energy that is stored in the rotating mass of the turbine. In this contribution two different control strategies are investigated and compared with each other. A type of control that is equal to the primary frequency control of large power plants shows the best results, both with respect to the power that is needed to limit the frequency drop and with respect to electrical and mechanical stress of the turbine. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Keysan2014,
abstract = {This thesis describes four novel superconducting machine concepts, in the pursuit of finding a suitable design for large offshore wind turbines. The designs should be reliable, modular and light-weight. The main novelty of the topologies reside in using a single loop shaped stationary superconducting field winding, which eliminates the rotating transfer couplers and electric brushes or brushless exciters. Furthermore, the electromagnetic forces in the superconducting wire are also eliminated, which simplifies the design and manufacturing of the cryostat and the support structure. Among the four topologies presented, the claw pole type machine is the most promising one. The rotor of the machine composes of claw-poles made from laminated electrical sheets, the superconducting field winding and the armature winding are stationary. The machine is analysed using 3D FEA simulations and a small linear machine prototype is manufactured to verify the simulations. For large scale applications, a double-sided claw pole machine is proposed, which has balanced magnetic attraction forces in the rotor. The machine has a modular cryostat structure, which increases the availability of the machine. Thus, even if a fault occurs in the cryocoolers or in the armature coils, the rest of the machine can operate at partial load until the maintenance is performed. Moreover, it is much easier to replace the faulty parts, as full disassemble of the machine is not required, and a small on- site crane can be used. As a result, it offers operational advantages over the existing superconducting topologies. A 10 MW, 10 rpm generator design is presented, which has a diameter of 6.6 m and an axial length of 1.4 m. The total active mass of the generator is 58 tonnes, and the structural mass is 126 tonnes, which gives a total mass of 184 tonnes. There are four independent cryostats and two independent armature windings in the machine to improve modularity. The biggest advantage of the design is the significantly less superconducting wire usage compared to any other designs; 10 MW machine just needs 15 km of MgB2 wire at 30 K. Thus, it is believed that the proposed topology is a very cost effective and suitable candidate for a successful entry to the wind turbine market.},

abstract = {When the wind power accounts for a large portion of the grid power, it may need to help the grid voltage and frequency regulation. This paper investigates a permanent-magnet wind generator with a full power voltage-source converter in weak-grid mode, where the DC-link voltage needs to be controlled from the generator side instead of the grid side. The energy relationship of the wind generator, DC-link energy storage, and load is established. An intrinsic right-half-plane zero, together with the wind power characteristics, the mechanical system inertia, and the DC-link energy storage, is identified as the physical limitations for the control. With the understanding of the system energy relationship and limitations, a hybrid adaptive control algorithm is proposed that searches for the optimal generator acceleration to achieve the maximum wind generator power change rate to match the load power variation. The proposed control scheme is verified through simulation of a 1.5-MW wind system as well as through the experiment of a scaled 1-kW, DSP-/field-programmable-gate-array-controlled, permanent-magnet-generator-based test bed. The results show that it is feasible to regulate DC link by the generator-side converter through the generator speed control. Some important applications issues are also investigated, including the DC-link energy storage requirement, wind speed change impact, and control transition between the weak-grid and strong-grid modes.},

abstract = {Future power systems could benefit considerably from having a continuous real-time estimate of system inertia. If realized, this could provide reference inputs to proactive control and protection systems which could enhance not only system stability but also operational economics through, for example, more informed ancillary reserve planning using knowledge of prevailing system conditions and stability margins. Performing these predictions in real time is a significant challenge owing to the complex stochastic and temporal relationships between available measurements. This paper proposes a statistical model capable of estimating system inertia in real time through observed steady-state and relatively small frequency variations; it is trained to learn the features that inter-relate steady-state averaged frequency variations and system inertia, using historical system data demonstrated over two consecutive years. The proposed algorithm is formulated as a Gaussian Mixture Model with temporal dependence encoded as Markov chains. Applied to the U.K. power system, it produces an optimized mean squared error within 0.1 s 2 for 95{\%} of the daily estimation if being calibrated on a half-hourly basis and maintains robustness through measurement interruptions of up to a period of two hours.},

abstract = {Galvanic isolation in grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) microinverters is a very important feature concerning power quality and safety issues. However, high-frequency transformers and high switching losses degrade the efficiency of the isolated types of microinverters. Recently, several isolated topologies were proposed to increase the efficiency and lifetime of PV converters. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the most recent isolated topologies of PV microinverters. These topologies are categorized into two groups in terms of their power processing stages: 1) single-stage microinverter and 2) multi-stage microinverter. Various topologies are presented, compared, and scrutinized in terms of the power losses at different stages, control techniques, position of the decoupling capacitor, and cost analysis. Recommendations are provided to improve the existing topologies and select the suitable control techniques to obtain a clear picture of the framework for next-generation isolated PV microinverters.},

abstract = {Europe celebrated last year (2008) the 100-year anniversary of the first liquefaction of helium by H. Kammerling Onnes in Leiden. It led to the discovery of superconductivity in 1911. Europe is still active in the development of superconducting (SC) devices. The discovery of high critical temperature materials in 1986, again in Europe, has opened a lot of opportunities for SC devices by broking the 4 K cryogenic bottleneck. Electric networks experience deep changes due to the emergence of dispersed generation (renewable among other) and to the advances in ICT (Information Communication Technologies). The networks of the future will be "smart grids". Superconductivity will offer "smart" devices for these grids like FCL (Fault Current Limiter) or VLI (Very Low Inductance) cable and would certainly play an important part. Superconductivity also will participate to the required sustainable development by lowering the losses and enhancing the mass specific powers. Different SC projects in Europe will be presented (Cable, FCL, SMES, Flywheel and Electrical Machine) but the description is not exhaustive. Nexans has commercialized the first two FCLs without public funds in the European grid (UK and Germany). The Amsterdam HTS cable is an exciting challenge in term of losses for long SC cables. European companies (Nexans, Air Liquide, Siemens, Converteam,...) are also very active for projects outside Europe (LIPA, DOE FCL,...). ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Due to failures in solar power measurement logging devices, a long period of solar power generation data might necessary to be recovered. In order to ensure that the recovered data is the correct one, the daily solar generation curve has to be investigated. Due to the high data amount, this control process has to be done automatically. It is observed that the daily solar generation curve is much similar to cosine wave. In this study, the recovered data is compared to reference cosine wave and it is aimed to identify the suspicious data group. In this context, this work is based on the normalized residuals test.},

abstract = {A concept is presented along with the overarching structure of the virtual power plant (VPP), the primary vehicle for delivering cost efficient integration of distributed energy resources (DER) into the existing power systems. The growing pressure, primarily driven by environmental concerns, for generating more electricity from renewables and improving energy efficiency have promoted the application of DER into electricity systems. So far, DER have been used to displace energy from conventional generating plants but not to displace their capacity as they are not visible to system operators. If this continues, this will lead to problematic over-capacity issues and under- utilisation of the assets, reduce overall system efficiency and eventually increase the electricity cost that needs to be paid by society. The concept of VPP was developed to enhance the visibility and control of DER to system operators and other market actors by providing an appropriate interface between these system components. The technical and commercial functionality facilitated through the VPP are described and concludes with case studies demonstrating the benefit of aggregation (VPP concept) and the use of the optimal power flow algorithm to characterise VPP.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

Low system inertia can allow large frequency declines to occur that could lead to violation of frequency security limits, particularly in smaller power systems, or play a key role in allowing cascading outages to occur. Future developments in power systems will mean that the system inertia will become highly variable and take values that would traditionally have been considered very low. Presented is a method for the robust estimation of the generator inertia available in the system during a disturbance. This method has been validated using simulations of the IEEE 39-bus system in DIgSILENTTM PowerFactory{\textregistered}.

abstract = {Numerical modeling of superconductors is widely recognized as a powerful tool for interpreting experimental results, understanding physical mechanisms, and predicting the performance of high-temperature-superconductor (HTS) tapes, wires, and devices. This is particularly true for ac loss calculation since a sufficiently low ac loss value is imperative to make these materials attractive for commercialization. In recent years, a large variety of numerical models, which are based on different techniques and implementations, has been proposed by researchers around the world, with the purpose of being able to estimate ac losses in HTSs quickly and accurately. This paper presents a literature review of the methods for computing ac losses in HTS tapes, wires, and devices. Technical superconductors have a relatively complex geometry (filaments, which might be twisted or transposed, or layers) and consist of different materials. As a result, different loss contributions exist. In this paper, we describe the ways of computing such loss contributions, which include hysteresis losses, eddy-current losses, coupling losses, and losses in ferromagnetic materials. We also provide an estimation of the losses occurring in a variety of power applications.},

Distributed power generation systems (DPGSs) based on renewable energy sources experience a large development worldwide, with Germany, Denmark, Japan, and USA as leaders in the development in this field. Due to the increasing number of DPGSs connected to the utility network, new and stricter standards in respect to power quality, safe running, and islanding protection are issued. As a consequence, the control of distributed generation systems should be improved to meet the requirements for grid interconnection. This paper gives an overview of the structures for the DPGS based on fuel cell, photovoltaic, and wind turbines. In addition, control structures of the grid-side converter are presented, and the possibility of compensation for low-order harmonics is also discussed. Moreover, control strategies when running on grid faults are treated. This paper ends up with an overview of synchronization methods and a discussion about their importance in the control},

Then, possible future generator systems are reviewed. Hydraulic transmissions are significantly lighter than gearboxes and enable continuously variable transmission, but their efficiency is lower. A brushless DFIG is a medium speed generator without brushes and with improved low-voltage ride-through characteristics compared with the DFIG. Magnetic pseudo DDs are smaller and lighter than DD generators, but need a sufficiently low and stable magnet price to be successful. In addition, superconducting generators can be smaller and lighter than normal DD generators, but both cost and reliability need experimental demonstration.

abstract = {Frequency response, the response of the power system to large, sudden mismatches between generation and load, has recently been garnering a lot of attention across all four interconnections in North America. This study was specifically designed to investigate the frequency response of California due to large loss-of-generation events of the type targeted by NERC Standard BAL-003 – Frequency Response and Bias, under near future system conditions with high levels of wind and solar generation. While this study addresses the overall frequency response of the Western grid, it does not address any changes to the limits of stability-limited transmission paths that may be warranted at higher penetration of variable energy resources. For this work, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) created a number of credible loadflow and stability base cases that represent high penetration of wind and solar generation expected in California in the near future. These cases were deliberately selected with the expectation that they would represent some of the most challenging conditions for CAISO with respect to frequency response. The study primarily focused on two cases: A winter low-load and high-wind condition case, and a weekend morning high-wind and high-solar condition case. These cases represent different operating conditions with a large number of synchronous generators displaced by variable renewable energy resources. In addition, some of the thermal power plants with synchronous generators were also assumed to be retired due to once-through-cooling (OTC) regulation. At the snapshot of time represented in these cases, the fraction of California generation coming from wind and solar plants was 37{\%} (11 GW total) and 50{\%} (15 GW total), respectively. Most of the simulations focused on the trip of two units at the Palo Verde Nuclear Power Station. This 2690 MW event is the largest loss-of-generation event in WECC for which involuntary load shedding and other stability consequences must be avoided.},

abstract = {Integration of distributed generation into distribution networks introduces new challenges to distribution system operators while the penetration level increases. One of the challenges is the voltage rise issue as a part of the steady-state analysis of DGs during planning and operational stages. This issue should be analyzed in order to determine the hosting capacity of distribution feeders in the first instance. Accordingly, Turkey is a promising candidate to integrate high penetration of DGs and has recently started to publish regulations for DGs. This paper presents a method to calculate DG hosting capacity of MV distribution feeders in Turkey. The presented calculation is compared with the current regulations in terms of load flow results. Additionally, this paper aims to ease the technical reviews of the DG integration with the presented method, which helps to assess the steady-state voltage impacts introduced by DGs. Finally, a general flow chart of steady-state analysis is proposed for Turkish DSOs.},

abstract = {Severe overvoltages have been detected in solar plants when switching the inverters off. These overvoltages damaged some pieces of low voltage equipment, in particular revenue meters and electronic devices associated with the inverters. The overvoltages take place when a switch upstream of the inverter (whether low or high voltage), in such way that one or several inverters become isolated from the rest of the grid. On the other hand, in large solar plants (several MW) fed by medium voltage busbars with no other load, it has been verified that overvoltages in the MV side reach dangerous values. Given that all systems are interconnected through their transformers, such overvoltages affect not only to the low voltage equipment, but to the medium or high voltage grid. The phenomenon is related to the interaction among the inverters until the anti-islanding protection trips. It must be pointed out that these islanding conditions are not considered in any standard. In any event, the problem is not the islanding detection, whose procedures are usually focused on a reliable detection when generation and consumption are balanced. The circumstances in which the overvoltage appears are the opposite, with a generation much higher than the load. Since standards are not applicable, it has been necessary to investigate this phenomenon in the field, testing several inverters in different solar plants. Several inverters, from different manufacturers, have been tested in wide-scale photovoltaic systems. The overvoltages, as well as the damages in meters, have been reproduced and recorded. This paper will present this new kind of overvoltage, specific of photovoltaic systems. The findings will be based on actual measurements in several wide-scale photovoltaic plants. Inverters used in solar plants behave as current sources, so they increase or decrease the voltage whatever is necessary to achieve the required current. It is this characteristic what creates an overvoltage when the net- work changes, reducing the load dramatically.},

The model should capture the wide range of dynamics related to the wind integration studies, such as voltage control, synchronizing power control, inertial response, frequency control, damping of electromechanical oscillations, balanced and unbalanced fault management, etc. Hence, the power system components: conventional power plants with controls, transmission lines, transformers and loads should be represented accurately to achieve realistic power system characteristics. Additionally, the power system model should be simple and computationally manageable in order to simulate multiple scenarios with different control parameters in a reasonable time. In this paper, a generic power system model is presented in order to comprehend the wind integration studies with different penetration scenarios.},

Following an instantaneous in-feed loss, regional variations in the estimate of inertia are obtained from measured frequency transients using installed synchronised phasor measurement units (PMUs). A method is proposed to first detect a suitable event for analysis, and then filter the measured transients in order to obtain a reliable estimate of inertia for a given region of the GB network. The total inertia for the whole system is then calculated as a summation, with an estimate also provided as to the contribution to inertia from residual sources, namely synchronously connected demand and embedded generation. The approach is first demonstrated on the full dynamic model of the GB transmission system, before results are presented from analyzing the impact of a number of instantaneous transmission in-feed loss events using phase-angle data provided by PMUs from the GB transmission network and also devices installed at the domestic supply at 4 GB universities.},

Furthermore, the proposed concept is validated experimentally using a buck-boost converter, fed by a solar PV array simulator (PVAS). Based on the EN 50530 dynamic irradiance tests, the pro- posed method achieved an average $\eta$MPP T almost 1.1{\%} higher than the conventional P{\&}O when irradiance changes slowly and about 12{\%} higher under fast change of irradiance.},

The results of the system analysis point out that the indirect system costs are currently quite small. However, the indirect system costs are increasing in coming years. Results show that photovoltaic has smaller indirect system costs than wind energy and photovoltaic reduces the costs of volatility which arise by using wind energy. In other words, model results indicate that several intermittent resources lead to a positive portfolio effect.},

Whereas increased system inertia is intrinsically linked to the addition of synchronous generation to power systems, due to differing electromechanical characteristics, this inherent link is not present in wind turbine generators. Regardless of wind turbine technology, the displacement of conventional generation with wind will result in increased rates of change of system frequency. The magnitude of the frequency excursion following a loss of generation may also increase. Amendment of reserve policies or modification of wind turbine inertial response characteristics may be necessary to facilitate increased levels of wind generation.

To create the model, we obtained some broad design information from the published documents of turbine manufacturers, with a heavy emphasis on the REpower 5M machine. Because detailed data was unavailable, however, we also used the publicly available properties from the conceptual models in the WindPACT, RECOFF, and DOWEC projects. We then created a composite from these data, extracting the best available and most representative specifications. This report documents the specifications of the NREL offshore 5-MW baseline wind turbine—including the aerodynamic, structural, and control-system properties—and the rationale behind its development. The model has been, and will likely continue to be, used as a reference by research teams throughout the world to standardize baseline offshore wind turbine specifications and to quantify the benefits of advanced land- and sea-based wind energy technologies.},

abstract = {We have examined the potential of 10 MW superconducting direct drive generators to enter the European offshore wind power market and estimated that the production of about 1200 superconducting turbines until 2030 would correspond to 10{\%} of the EU offshore market. The expected properties of future offshore turbines of 8 and 10 MW have been determined from an up-scaling of an existing 5 MW turbine and the necessary properties of the superconducting drive train are discussed. We have found that the absence of the gear box is the main benefit and the reduced weight and size is secondary. However, the main challenge of the superconducting direct drive technology is to prove that the reliability is superior to the alternative drive trains based on gearboxes or permanent magnets. A strategy of successive testing of superconducting direct drive trains in real wind turbines of 10 kW, 100 kW, 1 MW and 10 MW is suggested to secure the accumulation of reliability experience. Finally, the quantities of high temperature superconducting tape needed for a 10 kW and an extreme high field 10 MW generator are found to be 7.5 km and 1500 km, respectively. A more realistic estimate is 200–300 km of tape per 10 MW generator and it is concluded that the present production capacity of coated conductors must be increased by a factor of 36 by 2020, resulting in a ten times lower price of the tape in order to reach a realistic price level for the superconducting drive train.},

abstract = {Possible congestion management mechanisms for price-responsive electric vehicle demand in electricity distribution networks are investigated. Because a high penetration of renewable energy sources weakens the correlation between wholesale electricity prices and network demand, cost-minimizing electric vehicles may cause high peaks in network load. Managing congestion is not costly in theory but difficult to implement efficiently. Grid tariffs that are fixed ex ante, based on network load, were found to make the problem worse compared to the base-case scenario of flat tariffs. An optimal dynamic grid tariff yields desirable outcomes but is difficult to determine in case of realistic forecasting uncertainties. An iterative approach of a distribution grid capacity market has practical barriers related to IT infrastructure and computational requirements. Advance capacity allocation is more straightforward to implement, but the inter-temporal constraints of the electric vehicles continue to pose a challenge.},

abstract = {Optimal wind-power acquisition requires automatic tracking of the$\backslash$noptimum wind-turbine speed for the prevailing wind velocity. As the wind$\backslash$nvelocity keeps changing with time so the wind-turbine must keep$\backslash$nadjusting its speed. In a wind-farm, the wind velocities depend on the$\backslash$nlocations of the wind-turbines, each of which has its optimal turbine$\backslash$nspeed at any given time. With an eye to costs, the wind-farm of this$\backslash$npaper is conceived as operating with cheap induction generators driven$\backslash$nby variable-speed wind-turbines, without the expense of speed governors.$\backslash$nThis paper shows that the voltage-source converters of LVDC (low voltage$\backslash$ndirect current) transmission systems (which are now commercially$\backslash$navailable) can be tailored as speed-sensorless drives of the$\backslash$nwind-turbine induction generators, while meeting the objective of$\backslash$noptimal wind-power acquisition. The LVDC system aggregates the power of$\backslash$nmany wind-turbine induction-generator units into a DC grid. Then a DC$\backslash$nvoltage regulator inverts the collected power into a 3-phase AC electric$\backslash$nutility grid},

This paper describes the operation and control of one of these variable-speed wind generators: the direct driven permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). This generator is connected to the power network by means of a fully controlled frequency converter, which consists of a pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) rectifier, an intermediate dc circuit, and a PWM inverter. The generator is controlled to obtain maximum power from the incident wind with maximum efficiency under different load conditions. Vector control of the grid-side inverter allows power factor regulation of the windmill. This paper shows the dynamic performance of the complete system. Different experimental tests in a 3-kW prototype have been carried out to verify the benefits of the proposed system.},

abstract = {Wind power is an essential part of the strategy to address challenges facing the energy sector. Operation of the electricity network in 2020 will require higher levels of response and reserve from generation. The provision of inertial response from wind turbines was investigated. A model was developed for the simulation of frequency on the mainland UK system, including a simplified model for a synchronous generator to represent Full Power Converter turbines. Two different methods of inertia response, the step method and the inertia coupling method, were modelled and introduced into the turbine torque speed control. Simulations illustrated the effects on primary frequency control for a high penetration of wind turbines. Results are shown for different demand levels with generation losses of 1320GW and 1800GW. A comparison of the inertia functions is included and the effect of wind speed and the constant speed region of the maximum power extraction curve. For the scenarios modelled only a small change in turbine output was required for inertia response (0.02p.u). Without inertia response a large increase in synchronous plant response was needed. A test rig was constructed consisting of a Full Power Converter bridge and a synchronous generator driven by a dc machine. Power converters were designed and constructed by the candidate. Vector control of both the generator converter and grid converter was implemented on a dedicated control platform. The inertia coupling function was implemented and a test frequency deviation injected to represent a load generation imbalance. Results compared closely to those from the model and demonstrated the capability to closely couple turbine speed to system frequency with adjustment of the response via a filter if desired. The experimental work confirmed the adequacy of the simplified generator model and further confirmed the possibility of using inertia response.},

In this context, this paper develops a novel methodology to incorporate the frequency response support from wind plants into generation scheduling, thus enabling the benefits of alternative control strategies to be quantified. Studies are carried out on the future Great Britain power system with different wind energy penetration levels and frequency response requirements. The impact of the uncertainty associated with the quantity of wind plants being online and the energy recovery effect are also analyzed. The results demonstrate that the benefits of frequency response support from wind plants may be significant, although these are system specific. The proposed model could also inform the development of grid codes, market mechanisms, and business cases associated with the frequency response support from wind plants.},

abstract = {Electromagnetic railgun systems based on capacitive pulsed-power supply
(CPPS) have obtained widespread applications because of its obvious
advantages over the inductive ones on mature technology, operational
reliability, and feasible financial condition. However, the existing
CPPS-based electromagnetic railgun system works with low efficiency. In
this paper, systematical studies on the CPPS in the synchronously
triggered electromagnetic railgun system with constant volume and in the
time-delay-triggered electromagnetic railgun system with automatic
segmentation are proposed, respectively. In the synchronously triggered
electromagnetic railgun system, all pulse-forming units (PFUs) are
supposed to be triggered synchronously and the load is simplified as a
resistor first. Then, the system performance criteria, i.e., the launch
velocity of the armature vend and the system efficiency., are expressed
as the function of four independent system variables: 1) the capacitance
of each PFU C; 2) the precharged voltage UC of capacitors; 3) the rail
length l; and 4) the armature mass m. The relationship between. (or
vend) and any two independent variables can be found under the
environment of MATLAB R2012a by fixing the other two parameters. The
results are then verified under the environment of Simplorer 8. These
figures can be used to instruct the design of the pulsed-power supply
for a designated load or the railgun for a designated source. In the
time-delay-triggered electromagnetic railgun system, the principle of
automatic segmentation is proposed. According to the segmentation
principle, the simulation results under the environment of Simplorer 8
are given for comparison. The paper can provide a theoretical foundation
for the future designs to get higher system efficiency.},

The complex task of PMSM control in high-performance applications is currently usually resolved with classical vector control. Modern control techniques such as model predictive control can provide significant benefits over field oriented control, especially with straightforward controller tuning and constraints handling. Unfortunately, these new algorithms usually suffer from problems with their computational complexity. In the current paper, we present a PMSM control method based on an explicit model predictive control with a novel linearization and constraints handling method, allowing natural field weakening. The algorithm was designed with respect to computationally feasible implementation in the control hardware. The proposed control algorithm has been proved and successfully verified in both simulation and implementation on a real motor.},

An analytical approach based on a partitioned magnetic equivalent circuit is developed to determine the influence of magnet defect faults on PM motor variables. Due to the flexibility of the proposed method, the effect of each rotor magnets on each stator coil can be calculated to obtain the induced back electromotove force under faulty cases and observe the fault-related signatures in the frequency spectrum. The proposed tool significantly reduces the computational burden and provides sufficient accuracy, which significantly eases to simulate several magnet fault scenarios and examine detailed topology dependence relations in shorter time. Different cases, including various numbers and locations of defected magnets, winding configurations, and crack direction effects, are studied to understand the magnet defect influences comprehensively. The experiments and simulations are carried out at different speeds and load conditions to fully characterize the fault signatures. Comparative 2-D finite-element simulations and experimental results justify the theoretical magnet defect fault analysis and show the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

To enhance the robustness of stabilizing controllers against system uncertainties, this paper proposes a new coordinated robust control of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine equipped with power oscillation damper (POD) and synchronous generator installed with power system stabilizer (PSS) for stabilization of power system oscillations. Without the difficulty of mathematical representation, the inverse output multiplicative perturbation is used to model system uncertainties. The structure of POD and PSS is specified as a practical second-order lead/lag compensator with single input. The parameters optimization of POD and PSS is conducted so that the stabilizing performance and robustness of POD and PSS are augmented. The improved firefly algorithm is applied to solve the optimization problem and achieve the POD and PSS parameters automatically. Simulation study in the modified IEEE-39 bus New England system included with DFIG wind turbines ensures that the robustness and stabilizing performance of the proposed coordinat- ed DFIG with POD and PSS are much superior to those of the conventional DFIG with POD and PSS under various severe dis- turbances and system uncertainties.},

This paper presents a comprehensive performance comparison of an external rotor surface-mounted PM synchronous generator equipped with three commonly used winding types, i.e., integral-slot distributed winding (ISDW), fractional-slot concentrated winding (FSCW), and fractional-slot distributed winding. The tradeoff between torque and the power factor, loss distribution, current, torque, and PM demagnetization characteristics under a short-circuit fault and the steady temperature rise are investigated and compared using finite-element analyses. It is found that, generally, FSCW PM generators exhibit high rotor losses compared with ISDWs, which will lead to an overly high temperature rise. Measures such as segment PMs and the adoption of lamination steel in the rotor can reduce the rotor loss and greatly improve the machine efficiency. However, the temperature rise of FSCW machines is still higher than that of ISDW machines. The conclusion is intended to help choose the proper winding types.},

abstract = {Globally, buildings are responsible for 40{\%} of the total world annual energy consumption which is responsible for one-third of green house gas emissions around the world. A significant portion of this energy is used for lighting, heating, cooling, and air conditioning purposes in buildings. Increasing awareness of the environmental impact of green house gas emissions and CFCs triggered a renewed interest in environmentally friendly cooling, and heating technologies for buildings. Free cooling of buildings may be seen as an alternate to compressor based air conditioning systems used for the buildings. In free cooling, nighttime cold is accumulated in storage material and extracted when needed. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs) can be used for free-cooling purposes due to their high storage density. In free cooling, using PCM as storage material, cool air during night is used to solidify the PCM and the accumulated cold is extracted during the hot day times. In this article a detailed review of work conducted by different researchers on PCM based free cooling is presented. Major challenges being faced in the design of PCM based free cooling system such as phase change materials; their thermo-physical properties and the geometry of encapsulation are elaborated and discussed in detail. Also the parameters effecting the charging and discharging of PCM, effect of phase change temperature and climatic conditions on thermal performance of the free cooling system are also discussed. Potential reduction in CO2 emissions due to the applicability of free cooling systems in residential and commercial buildings is also discussed in this article. This paper also provides a comprehensive list of the PCMs currently being used and that can be used potentially for free cooling applications. At last, this paper also presents some current problems needed further research in this area. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = { Over the last two decades, several mechanisms of armature transition have been postulated. Each mechanism has been subjected to experimental and analytic examination with the objective of "explaining" transition. However, no single mechanism has emerged as the consensus cause of transition. In this paper, we take the position that all the mechanisms that have been identified, and perhaps others which have not yet been, contribute to and may be mutually influenced by those processes leading to the onset of transition. Our inability to correlate transition with a single mechanism, or model, results from the multiplicity of mechanisms at work. We examine all the mechanisms identified to date, suggest several additional ones, and explore a more complex transition world in which each transition event is potentially caused by a different mechanism or combination of mechanisms. With this picture, control of transition requires that we control all of the mechanisms which can result in transition, not just one.},

abstract = {Optical current transformers/transducers (OCTs) produce digital and analog signals. In recent years, they have become more available, playing an increasingly important role in electric power grid upgrades. This requires developing accurate models for relay testing and relay performance evaluations to ensure that the system equipment is safe. This study presents several models developed for OCT: analog, digital, and complete models. It applies previously studied and presented frequency-response characteristics to develop a transfer function using a complex curve-fitting method. An analog circuit model is constructed from the developed transfer function via a network synthesis method. A digital model is presented by transforming the developed transfer function into a digital domain transfer function using bilinear transformation. The digital model implementation is performed by the direct form I block diagram. The optics model and electronics model of the device are developed separately and are then combined to present a complete model. The Jones calculus method is used for optical modeling, and a developed transfer function is used for electronics modeling. All of the developed models are verified through the frequency-response results and tested with PSpice and Matlab Simulink programs. The results show that the developed models can be used as legitimate OCT models.},

abstract = {Many geared electric drives can benefit from removing the gearbox and driving directly the load at low speed using a permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings are particularly attractive in low-speed direct drives since they allow, among other advantages, a high number of poles with a limited number of slots. Therefore, this thesis is dedicated to PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings designed for low-speed directdrive applications. First, the design features specific to PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings are presented and illustrated with examples based on finite-element (FE) simulations. Especially, it is shown that the selections of the stator core manufacturing method, the number of winding layers, the combination of pole and slot numbers, and the geometry of the tooth tips are crucial during the design stage of the machine. Second, the benefits of removing the gearbox in a 4.5 kW, 50 rpm mixer used in a waste-water treatment plant are investigated. With its PMSM having buried ferrite magnets and concentrated windings, the designed direct-drive mixer has a higher efficiency than the commercialized geared mixer, but it is also heavier and more expensive due to the larger required housing, shaft and seals. In addition, the cost of the stator core and coil assembly was also higher than expected. Therefore, the difficulties in manufacturing a stator core with concentrated windings are investigated. Mainly due to economical aspects, no prototype motor has been built for the direct-drive mixer. Finally, measurements on a prototype motor at disposal having a large constantpower speed range are performed. Three methods to measure the inductances without using a position sensor are provided and compared. One of the methods is a new test at load conditions to determine the inductance without the knowledge of the rotor position. Results from this method agree well with a conventional blocked rotor test, as well as with results from 3D-FE simulations. Furthermore, the measurements of the magnetic flux obtained with search coils placed in different parts of the stator are analyzed. The analysis allows highlighting the zigzag flux flowing from one magnet to another through a tooth tip, which is characteristic of PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings. It is shown that this zigzag flux leakage causes high iron losses in the tooth tips that represent approximately 50{\%} of the stator iron losses under field weakening operation. Using these measurements, the 3D-FE model of the prototype is also validated thoroughly.},

The paper also identifies the models of pitch regulated wind turbines in a power system with hydro power dominated. Short-term extra active power, inertia emulation and direct pitch angle regulation as a primary frequency control are evaluated when there is a power imbalance. In addition, the combinations of these three methods are evaluated. Simulation results show that the combination of temporary extra active power and inertia emulation method has the highest value of temporary minimum frequency. However it is slower than other proposed methods and has second frequency drop. The advantage of using direct pitch angle regulation separately or in combining with the two other methods is that, the rotor speed does not decrease below the value that it has before the power imbalance happens. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The CCEMG launcher is a series-augmented barrel 2.25 m in length and has a rectangular bore cross section of 17.3 mm{\&}times;37.3 mm. The system is designed to operate with a peak current of 835 kA, a launch package mass of 185 g, and an exit velocity of 1,850 m/s. CCEMG is a multishot system demonstrator. The test results we discuss here are for single-shot operation. The muzzle voltage in an augmented launcher contains contributions from the fields due to the augmenting turn. These imposed voltage terms tend to mask the transition of the armature contact, thereby making the transition event less discernable than in a simple railgun. The Army Railgun Modular Simulator (ARMS) computer code has been modified to provide a one-dimensional (1-D), lumped parameter model of the launcher and contact wear at the armature-to-rail interface. The CCEMG launcher data are used to further validate the ARMS code and contact wear model. Additionally, a two-dimensional, transient finite difference (2-D TFD) model is used to assess heating in the armature. In this paper we present photographic and electrical data from two shots in which armature performance is simulated},

In the present work, we describe and implement a methodology to construct detailed temporal and spatial representations of demand response resources and to incorporate those resources into power system models.

abstract = {As the development and installation of photovoltaic (PV) systems are still growing at an exceptionally rapid pace, relevant grid integration policies are going to change consequently in order to accept more PV systems in the grid. The next generation PV systems will play an even more active role like what the conventional power plants do today in the grid regulation participation. Requirements of ancillary services like Low-Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) associated with reactive current injection and voltage support through reactive power control, have been in effectiveness in some countries. Those advanced features can be provided by next-generation PV systems, and will be enhanced in the future to ensure an even efficient and reliable utilization of PV systems. In the light of this, Reactive Power Injection (RPI) strategies for single-phase PV systems are explored in this paper. The RPI possibilities are: a) constant average active power control, b) constant active current control, c) constant peak current control and d) thermal optimized control strategy. All those strategies comply with the currently active grid codes, but are with different objectives. The thermal optimized control strategy is demonstrated on a 3 kW single-phase PV system by simulations. The other three RPI strategies are verified experimentally on a 1 kW singe-phase system in LVRT operation mode. Those results show the effectiveness and feasibilities of the proposed strategies with reactive power control during LVRT operation. The design and implementation considerations for the characterized strategies are also discussed.},

The comparison is based on cost and annual energy yield for a given wind climate. The doubly-fed induction generator with single-stage gearbox seems the most attractive in terms of energy yield divided by cost. The doubly-fed induction generator with three-stage gearbox is a cheap solution using standard components. The permanent-magnet direct-drive generator has the highest energy yield, but although it is cheaper than the electrically-excited direct-drive generator, it is more expensive than the generator systems with gearbox},

abstract = {The U.S. continues a broad spectrum of research to provide the scientific underpinnings for electromagnetic launch. These efforts include fundamental research on materials, properties of materials subjected to electromagnetic and thermal stresses, railguns (particularly the rail-armature sliding interface), coilguns, and energy storage and power conditioning. There is also broad and growing interest in novel applications of electromagnetic launch. For example, a supersonic beam of neon atoms have been slowed and stopped, opening the door for investigating the atomic and molecular properties of most of the periodic table of atoms and certain molecules. Research is continuing on magnetic brakes and the more traditional research on the launch of materials to hypervelocities. More recently, the launching of materials into the Earth's orbit or even deeper in space is obtaining renewed interest. Consequently, some attention is being given to the types of materials of projectiles for hypersonic flight. The U.S. Navy has initiated new multidisciplinary university research teams including physics, chemistry, and materials science to develop new diagnostic tools and to provide a more detailed examination of the rail-armature interface. Most significantly, the U.S. Army has elevated its emphasis from electromagnetic launch science and technology development to the operational consequences of long-range precision fires. In concert with the recent U.S. Navy efforts on long-range fires, it is anticipated that the pull of these applications will enable even greater advances in the science and technology of electromagnetic launch.},

abstract = {This article presents the outcomes of a recent study carried out among wind energy manufacturers and developers regarding the current generation costs of wind energy projects in Europe, the factors that most influence them, as well as the reasons behind their recent increase and their expected future evolution. The research finds that the generation costs of an onshore wind farm are between 4.5 and 8.7 ???cent/kWh; 6-11.1 ???cent/kWh when located offshore, with the number of full hours and the level of capital cost being the most influencing elements. Generation costs have increased by more than 20{\%} over the last 3 years mainly due to a rise of the price of certain strategic raw materials at a time when the global demand has boomed. However, the competitive position of wind energy investments vis-??-vis other technologies has not been altered. In the long-term, one would expect production costs go down; whether this will be enough to offset the higher price of inputs will largely depend on the application of correct policies, like R{\&}D in new materials, O{\&}M with remote-control devices, offshore wind turbines and substructures; introduction of advanced siting and forecasting techniques; access to adequate funding; and long-term legal stability. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = { Magnetic blow-off forces play an important role in arcing and failure of electrical joints and contacts in electrical systems under high current fault conditions. Magnetic blow-off forces arise from concentration of current in the contact interface and tend to blow the contacts apart, causing separation and arcing. Simple models have been developed to predict the magnitude of these forces and permit the design of joints and contacts that can successfully resist the forces. In this paper, the role of magnetic blow-off in railgun armature contacts is explored. It is shown that magnetic blow-off forces are important and may be the final step in a series of events that ultimately leads to transition. Models that predict the conditions under which blow-off will occur are developed, and supporting experimental data is described.},

In many MPC problems, a long prediction horizon is required to ensure an adequate closed-loop performance in steady state and to avoid stability issues. However, the computational effort of solving the optimization problem underlying MPC problems with long prediction horizons is often very great, making the implementation of such schemes in real time a difficult and challenging task. To overcome this difficulty, three established methodologies are surveyed that yield long prediction horizons with a modest computational burden. Case studies are investigated to substantiate the merits of these schemes. More specifically, for dc?dc boost converters, a move blocking strategy is reviewed, and for ac medium-voltage (MV) drives, both an extrapolation and an event-based horizon strategy are examined.},

abstract = {The inertia of today's power system decreases as more and more converter connected generation units and load are integrated in the power system. This results in a power system which behaves differently from before which causes concerns for many grid operators. Therefore, a detailed study is needed to investigate the relevance of this inertia in the operation, control and stability of the system. Moreover, a new definition of the term system inertia is necessary since is it expected that in the future also the renewable electricity generation units will deliver the so-called virtual (synthetic) inertia. In this paper a review of the research related to inertia in a power system is given. Both the challenges as the solutions from an operator point of view to control a system with low inertia are discussed. Also a new definition of inertia is proposed to incorporate the different forms of inertia which are each described in more detail. From recent studies, it can be concluded that the influence of reduced inertia on frequency stability is generally considered as the main challenge for system operators, but with the additional measures listed in this paper, this impact can be mitigated.},

In this paper, a new control approach for the 200 kW solar photovoltaic grid connected system with perturb and observe maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique is implemented. Power quality improvement with comparison is conducted during fault with proportional integral (PI) and artificial intelligence-based fuzzy logic controlled DVR. MPPT tracks the actual variable DC link voltage while deriving the maximum power from a photovoltaic array and maintains DC link voltage constant by changing modulation index of the converter. Simulation results during fault show that the fuzzy logic based DVR scheme demonstrates simultaneous exchange of active and reactive power with less total harmonic distortion (THD) present in voltage source converter (VSC) current and grid current with fast tracking of optimum operating point at unity power factor. Standards (IEEE-519/1547), stipulates that the current with THD greater than 5{\%} cannot be injected into the grid by any distributed generation source. Simulation results and validations of MPPT technique and operation of fuzzy logic controlled DVR demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.},

By simulation, the inverter performance is evaluated in the presence of the wind speed distribution profile and the reference switching frequency value for SiC devices in this topology at this power level is determined.

abstract = {A capacitor bank, consisting of two stages, is used for experiments with a 50 mm round bore railgun at a maximum current of 2 MA. The railgun is fed at two different points in order to test the DES-railgun concept. An appropriate design and material choice of metallic projectiles, accelerated from the rest position, allow the current to be injected at the front side and to be distributed over the whole armature. It is shown that the contact between rails and projectile is maintained with a dominant metallic value and transitioning to plasma arcs has been seen only during short time intervals.

abstract = {A metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) (rating at 500 V/24 A) half-bridge power switching subassembly with gate drivers has been fabricated, employing a planar integration technology, in which an integrated power chips stage is built by embedding chips in a coplanar ceramic substrate with a metallization thin-film interconnection built up onto it. This deposited metallization not only bonds the power chips, but also provides the second-level interconnect wiring. The associated components are mounted on top of the integrated power stage. This packaging scheme results in a three-dimensional (3-D) multiple chips/components assembly with the capability of functional integration. In this paper, the electrical and thermal parameters of this packaged module have been experimentally and theoretically characterized. The procedures adopted for the defined fabrication processes are presented. In addition to the characteristics of the planar integration process, the improved electrical and thermal performance has been demonstrated.},

abstract = {Pulse alternator-based pulse power systems for electromagnetic rail guns store the required energy for powering the rail gun as stored mechanical inertial energy in the rotating member. The pulse alternator (PA) converts the stored inertial energy into electrical energy that is supplied to the rail gun terminals. The losses in the system and energy delivered to the rail gun projectile reduce the stored inertial energy of the pulse alternator by reducing the operating speed. Pulse alternators require a charging mechanism to accelerate the rotor of the alternator to the desired speed, providing the mechanical stored energy. This is generally accomplished by a motor attached to the alternator shaft. This paper describes the design, manufacture and initial testing of a high speed, water- cooled permanent-magnet (PM) synchronous motor specially designed to accelerate a high speed pulse alternator. The charging motor has been designed to accelerate the pulse alternator from zero speed to full rated alternator speed and to accelerate the alternator back to rated speed after the pulse discharge. Two PM motors are also used to synchronize two separate paralleled pulse alternators prior to discharge into a rail gun load. The PM motor is directly attached to the PA shaft and designed to minimize the axial footprint of the assembly. The motor is operated in a continuous duty cycle which requires water cooling of the stator assembly and air cooling of the rotor. The PM synchronous motor is powered by a variable-frequency, variable voltage electronic drive and operated in a constant torque mode.},

abstract = {Parameters identification of permanent magnetic synchronous motor (PMSM), which significantly influences the control performance of the drive system, is an impor-tant and challenging task of power electronic system. The problem requires both high solution quality and fast conver-gence speed due to the constraints of hardware. This paper presents a self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm with hybrid mutation operator (SHDE) for parameters identifi-cation problem. In this method, a novel mutation operator, called " current-to-archive-best, " is developed by mixing the best solutions randomly selected from archive set and current population. Thus, the algorithm could use the best searching memories so far to generate promising solutions, yielding a faster evolving procedure. Besides, the corresponding control parameters of SHDE are also self-adapted without tedious trial-and-error progress to get appropriate values. Moreover, the parameters estimation program is inserted into the PMSM simulation that is solved by using Newton–Raphson method without any pre-assumption and simplification. This frame-work, which may be used under any working conditions with large disturbance, is different from other publications, resulting in wider applications. The proposed method applied to parameters identification of PMSM is evaluated on a PMSM drive system with two different operations. The com-prehensive results and statistical analyses, compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, show that SHDE could find high-quality solutions with higher convergence speed and probability.

abstract = { A two-dimensional model, developed previously to investigate the transport of electromagnetic fields and energy in solid-armature railguns, is simplified to study exclusively heating within the interior of the armature. The simplifying assumptions, made in order to reduce the time required for calculations, include neglecting the effects of velocity as well as the details of the physics occurring at the rail-armature interface. These assumptions are not believed to be particularly restrictive when the intent of the calculations is to investigate regions of the armature that are far removed from the rails. The governing equations, appropriate under this set of assumptions, are presented. The model is then applied to analyze current and heat transport in a double-taper sabot armature, a type of armature that is currently under active study and is known to be valuable in launching high-density tactical payloads. In particular, calculations are undertaken to investigate the manner in which a variation of certain geometrical parameters that define the shape of the armature affect the time evolution and spatial distribution of temperature, fields, and forces within the armature. Results of the calculations are studied carefully and explained by basic physical principles.},

RES units, notably inverter-connected wind turbines and PV that as such do not provide rotational inertia, are effectively displacing conventional generators and their rotating machinery. The traditional assumption that grid inertia is sufficiently high with only small variations over time is thus not valid for power systems with high RES shares. This has implications for frequency dynamics and power system stability and operation. Frequency dynamics are faster in power systems with low rotational inertia, making frequency control and power system operation more challenging.   This paper investigates the impact of low rotational inertia on power system stability and operation, contributes new analysis insights and offers impact mitigation options.},

It is found that the effectiveness of skewing largely depends on the axial variation of a torque ripple phase but less on its magnitude under skewing. It is further found that, in both linear and nonlinear cases, the EM and the on-load torque ripple cannot be fully eliminated by skewing one on-load torque ripple period or any other angles, except 360° electrical, which is impractical. This is due to the fact that the EM torque ripple, especially its phase, of each slice is different due to the axial variation of the equivalent current phase advance angle introduced by skewing. In nonlinear cases, the EM torque ripple variation is further aggravated by the axial variation of magnetic saturation. The EM torque ripple as well as the on-load torque ripple may be even increased by skewing, especially when the cogging torque is low and electric loading is high.},

abstract = {Increasing power system flexibility by responsive demand is a central issue for the incorporation of higher levels of variable wind generation in future power systems. The electrification of the heat sector, except from energy efficiency gains, may offer a vast potential of new forms of flexible demand, by time-shifting of heat production in buildings. The assessment of this potential can, however, be performed only when the limitations imposed by the primary operation of the equipment (space heating) are realistically taken into account. In this paper, a methodology is presented for the quantification of the flexibility offered by the thermal storage of building stock equipped with heat pumps, to power systems with significant penetration of wind power. A model is proposed for the incorporation of the building stock thermal behavior as equivalent energy storage in electricity market models. At the same time, the model allows the coupling to a detailed dynamic thermal model of buildings for the assessment of the respective operational restrictions. The case study presents the results of a project for the evaluation of the flexibility offered by portfolios of high heat pump deployment in conjunction with high wind penetration scenarios for the future German electricity system.},

The proposed PM shape is designed to be sinusoidal and symmetrical in the axial direction for minimizing the amount of rare earth magnets as well as for providing balanced axial electromagnetic force, which turns out to obtain better sinusoidal electromotive force, less cogging torque, and, consequently, smooth electromagnetic torque. The contribution of the novel PM shape to motor characteristics is first estimated by 3-D finite-element method, and all of the simulation results are compared with those of SPM motors with two conventional arched PM shapes: one previously reported sinusoidal PM shape and one step skewed PM shape. Finally, some finite-element analysis results are confirmed by experimental results.},

abstract = { This paper discusses the development of a design tool that couples two-dimensional (2-D) electromagnetics (EM) with three-dimensional (3-D) dynamic structural mechanics. The resulting model has the capability for rapid performance assessment of railgun and armature structures. The coupling of codes is one-way in that no deformations are provided to the EM code once the calculations begin. An efficient and accurate 2-D EM code is used to generate the thermal and mechanical loads. It is well known that the 2-D EM solution for a solid armature railgun grossly compromises the calculation as compared to the 3-D formulation for isolated regions in the armature and conducting boundary. However, despite this drawback, some success has been obtained in comparing experimental results to the 2-D computations with velocity skin effect, as well as favorable comparisons between 2-D and static 3-D computations. At the present time, there is no code available that accurately captures the entire launch process and physics leading up to and including transition of the armature contacts. It is anticipated that with development of design rules and methodology, the electromagnetic field solution can be extended to 3-D as well as automated to the point that very little computer time and user intervention are required.},

abstract = { We develop an analytical model for predicting the eddy-current loss in the rotor magnets of permanent-magnet brushless machines that have a fractional number of slots per pole, when either all the teeth or only alternate teeth are wound, and in which the unwound teeth may be narrower than the wound teeth. The model enables the magnetic field distribution in the air gap and magnet regions to be determined, by neglecting the eddy-current redistribution effect and assuming that the eddy currents are resistance limited. It can account for space-harmonic magnetomotive forces (MMFs) resulting from the winding distribution and time-harmonic MMFs due to nonsinusoidal phase currents, as well as for the effect of curvature and circumferential segmentation of the magnets. We have validated the model by finite-element analysis, and used it to investigate the eddy-current loss in the magnets of three surface-mounted magnet brushless motors that have similar slot and pole numbers, and employ identical rotors but different stators, when they are operated in brushless ac (BLAC) and dc (BLDC) modes. We show that the stator winding configuration, as well as the operational mode, significantly influence the resultant eddy-current loss.},

Realistic intra-hour load balancing signals are used to evaluate the operational char- acteristics of the HVAC load under different outdoor temperature profiles and different indoor temperature settings. The number of HVAC unitsneededisalsoinvestigated. Modeling results suggest that the number of HVAC units needed to provide a -MW load balancing service 24 hours a day varies significantly with baseline settings, high and low temperature settings, and outdoor temperatures. The results demonstrate that the intra-hour load balancing service provided byHVAC loadsmeets the performance requirements and can become a major source of revenue for load-serving entities where the two-way communication smart grid infrastructure enables direct load control over the HVAC loads.},

C-armatures were launched on the Medium Caliber Launcher at the Institute for Advanced Technology (IAT), Leander, TX, and recovered by "soft catching" in a tube filled with cotton rags. Recovered armatures were mechanically profiled to measure erosion depth as a function of position on the contacting surfaces. Although recovered armatures provide only a final snapshot of the erosion process, one can show how erosion proceeds by recovering armatures at different stages of the launch. This type of study requires the use of a crowbar switch at the breech of the railgun to rapidly shunt current out of the armature, thereby interrupting the erosion process at the desired point in the launch. We describe the experimental setup and summarize the results of 11 experiments. The experiments investigated the effect of linear current density (ranging from 35 to 45 kA/mm) and rail material (copper and aluminum) on MWE damage. Lastly, we present some thoughts on contact transition mechanisms that, in some cases, prevented the collection of MWE data.},

abstract = {Diffusion-controlled erosion of armatures, which is accentuated by the velocity skin effect, gives rise to nonuniform current conduction and consequent nonuniform heating. Earlier computational studies have highlighted the role played by armature geometry in current density and temperature distribution. Recently, we designed modified C-shaped armatures, called saddle-shaped armatures, to study the effect of geometry change on armature erosion and its consequent effect on rail deposits. The trailing edge and the throat of the armature were curved to better align with the magnetic field, thus reducing the nonuniformity of current density distribution. A front tab was also provided to reduce current concentration and heating at the leading edge of the contact area. Low-speed tests, in which armatures were recovered and compared with recovered conventional C-shaped armatures, were conducted. Similar experiments at speeds above 2 km/s were conducted and compared with corresponding C-shaped armature experiments. It was found that in conformation with our hypothesis, the saddle-shaped armatures recovered from low-speed shots showed less erosion both on the contact surface and in the throat area. The high-speed tests showed that the contact voltage for saddle-shaped armatures was significantly lower than that for conventional C-shaped armatures. This implies less energy loss at the rail-armature interface and potentially less lateral force generated during contact arcing},

abstract = {Multilevel converters, such as the modular multilevel converter (MMC) or the alternate arm converter (AAC), rely on charged capacitors in their cells to generate their AC voltage waveform. Since the cell capacitors are physically large and occupy approximately half the cell volume, their capacitance must be kept minimal while limiting the voltage fluctuation caused by the current passing periodically through these capacitors. This study proposes a mathematical model which estimates the energy deviation for the stacks of both the MMC and the AAC during steady-state operation under any power factor and for AC voltage magnitude fluctuation of up to ±10{\%}. The analysis is then used to calculate the minimum size for the cell capacitors in order to keep their voltage fluctuation within set boundaries for both topologies. The results show that the MMC requires 39 kJ/MVA of capacitive energy storage under sinusoidal modulation but this reduces with triplen injection modulation. The AAC has a lower requirement for storage in its cells of 11 kJ/MVA but the AAC has a six-pulse DC current ripple which requires a filter estimated to have a further 33{\%} capacitive storage.},

abstract = {High-performance current control is required to obtain a smooth output torque in permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM){\&}{\#}x00A0;drives. In this manner, a new discrete-time robust predictive current controller is presented for PMSM drives. Controller and current prediction schemes are designed based on the dead-beat structure. The dead-beat control has good transient response, but it suffers from parametric uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics. In order to provide robustness, a discrete-time integral term is added to the dead-beat current prediction. The stability analysis is carried out considering the prediction error dynamics, nonlinear uncertain model of PMSM, and the integral action as the states of the overall system. The designed robust predictive controller is tested through numerical simulations and experiments. The proposed controller is easy to implement and suitable for high-performance PMSM applications.},

abstract = {This paper has two purposes: 1) to clarify the relationship between the quantum theory of radiation, where the electromagnetic field-expansion coefficients satisfy commutation relations, and the semiclassical theory, where the electromagnetic field is considered as a definite function of time rather than as an operator; and 2) to apply some of the results in a study of amplitude and frequency stability in a molecular beam maser. In 1), it is shown that the semiclassical theory, when extended te take into account both the effect of the field on the molecules and the effect of the molecules on the field, reproduces almost quantitatively the same laws of energy exchange and coherence properties as the quantized field theory, even in the limit of one or a few quanta in the field mode. In particular, the semiclassical theory is shown to lead to a prediction of spontaneous emission, with the same decay rate as given by quantum electrodynamics, described by the Einstein A coefficients. In 2), the semiclassical theory is applied to the molecular beam maser. Equilibrium amplitude and frequency of oscillation are obtained for an arbitrary velocity distribution of focused molecules, generalizing the results obtained previously by Gordon, Zeiger, and Townes for a singel-velocity beam, and by Lamb and Helmer for a Maxwellian beam. A somewhat surprising result is obtained; which is that the measurable properties of the maser, such as starting current, effective molecular Q, etc., depend mostly on the slowest 5 to 10 per cent of the molecules. Next we calculate the effect of amplitude and frequency of oscillation, of small systematic perturbations. We obtain a prediction that stability can be improved by adjusting the system so that the molecules emit all their energy h $\Omega$ to the field, then reabsorb part of it, before leaving the cavity. In general, the most stable operation is obtained when the molecules are in the process of absorbing energy from the radiation as they leave the cavity, most unstable when they are still emitting energy at that time. Finally, we consider the response of an oscillating maser to randomly time-varying perturbations. Graphs are given showing predicted response to a small superimposed signal of a frequency near the - oscillation frequency. The existence of "noise enhancing" and "noise quieting" modes of operation found here is a general property of any oscillating system in which amplitude is limited by nonlinearity.},

abstract = {In this paper, a permanent magnet alternator which presently relies on magnetic slot wedges is redesigned to give lower iron loss. The new segmented stator design is used as the basis for a validated loss study - comparing bonded lamination stacks with those held together with a punched notch. Segmentation is shown to improve the production process, reduce losses, and remove the need for wedges, while not significantly altering the acoustic performance. In the first series of prototypes, however, where notching is used to secure lamination packs, the process is shown to have adversely affected material properties of the nickel iron laminations and overall measured losses increased. In the second prototype, with thinner laminations and glued stacks, iron loss predictions and measurement agree and are less than the present slot wedge design. {\textcopyright} 1986-2012 IEEE.},

@article{Wu2014,
abstract = {With the increasing wind penetration level in power systems, transmission system operators have become concerned about frequency stability. The inertia of a variable speed wind turbine is decoupled by power electronic converters from the power network and therefore does not intrinsically contribute to power system inertia. Moreover, as wind plant progressively displaces conventional generation and their inertia, a substantial reduction in power system inertia may occur. Variable speed wind turbines can be controlled to provide synthetic inertial response to compensate for their lack of direct contribution to power system inertia. A probabilistic approach to assessing the collective inertial contributions from wind generation across a power system is proposed and is applied to the Great Britain power system. The impact of the aggregate inertial response on arresting frequency fall is examined for the case of a sudden generation loss of 1.8 GW at the time of minimum load on both a mid-summer and a mid-winter day. The results show that synthetic inertial response from wind can reduce the rate of fall of frequency and the minimum system frequency (nadir) following the loss of generation event.},

The proposed architecture is unique in the sense that the methodology can be used for frequency regulation support during subsynchronous and super-synchronous operation of the wind turbines (farm). The architecture work with existing wind farm controllers thus avoiding any additional replacement or tuning. The methodology depends on reduced order modeling based on model order reduction (MOR) and subsequent online controller design. The approach is tested on a smaller wind farm and further evaluated on a larger reduced power grid with 39 buses and ten generators. The results show that the proposed architecture provides greater flexibility in wind farm control towards frequency oscillations.},

The power electronic components were mounted on the inside of a new end cover which was equipped with an extensive array of fins cooled by air from the external fan. The electronic components were insulated from the air in the end region of the motor. A heat sink plate was installed within the motor behind the end cover to conduct the heat from the motor that would otherwise have been dissipated through the end cover. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to model the ventilation and heat transfer from the new end cover and to develop improved fan geometries. It was concluded that CFD can be used effectively to design motor cooling systems.

abstract = {An interconnected electric power system is a complex system that must be operated within a safe frequency range in order to reliably maintain the instantaneous balance between generation and load. This is accomplished by ensuring that adequate resources are available to respond to expected and unexpected imbalances and restoring frequency to its scheduled value in order to ensure uninterrupted electric service to customers. Electrical systems must be flexible enough to reliably operate under a variety of "change" scenarios. System planners and operators must understand how other parts of the system change in response to the initial change, and need tools to manage such changes to ensure reliable operation within the scheduled frequency range. This report presents a systematic approach to identifying metrics that are useful for operating and planning a reliable system with increased amounts of variable renewable generation which builds on existing industry practices for frequency control after unexpected loss of a large amount of generation. The report introduces a set of metrics or tools for measuring the adequacy of frequency response within an interconnection. Based on the concept of the frequency nadir, these metrics take advantage of new information gathering and processing capabilities that system operators are developing for wide-area situational awareness. Primary frequency response is the leading metric that will be used by this report to assess the adequacy of primary frequency control reserves necessary to ensure reliable operation.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, The Institution of Engineering and Technology. This study investigates the frequency behaviour in the Nordic power system (NPS) utilising phasor measurement units (PMUs) from different locations in the system. Different metrics are selected or proposed to quantify the system frequency response in case of major disturbances and of daily normal operations. Based on the collected PMU data, there are on average 17.5 major, generator disconnection related, disturbances per year. The maximum absolute rate of change of frequency exceeds 0.1 Hz/s for 20{\%} of these disturbances. The average frequency nadir falls to 49.7 $\backslash$Hz, and the average time to nadir is about 8.7 s. If wind turbines were to be requested to provide inertia support to the system, these four metrics indicate how often, how fast, for how much and for how long the wind turbines should act. Moreover, during daily normal operations, the system has in general longer duration of over-frequency (f  {\textgreater}  50.1 Hz) than under-frequency (f  {\textless}  49.9 Hz). These frequency deviations are observed to occur around the hourly clearing of the Nord Pool Spot market and, especially during the hours between 05:00 and 08:00. In order to improve the frequency quality, the Nordic system operators tested and implemented an automatic frequency restoration reserve (aFRR) in addition to the existing manual one. Based on a frequency evaluation, this aFRR is needed most during 4:45-08:15 and 22:00-23:30 o'clock in 2012 in the NPS.},

abstract = {The use of brush armatures for accelerating railgun projectiles allows muzzle velocities in excess of 2.5 km/s and contact transition velocities of at least 1.8 km/s in middle-caliber launchers to be obtained. The technology developed at ISL is based on the use of multiple brush armatures. Asymmetric wear has been observed in dynamic launch experiments when the brushes were separated in shot direction. This indicates the presence of asymmetric current distribution. In this paper, mechanisms determining the current distribution of multiple brush armatures are investigated using a static approach. Experiments were performed using a section of the ISL EMA3 railgun with 270-mm-long rails. It had a caliber of 15 mm {\textless}formula formulatype="inline"{\textgreater}{\textless}tex Notation="TeX"{\textgreater}{\$}\backslashtimes{\$}{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}{\textless}/formula{\textgreater} 30 mm and was connected to a 150-kJ capacitor bank. Three series of experiments focusing on specific parameter variations are presented. The current distributions were recorded using small Rogowski coils placed around the brushes. Magnetoresistive sensors were used for highly local measurements of magnetic fields in the vicinity of the brushes. Results reveal insight into the contact behavior of multiple brush armatures. More specifically, phase transitions at the brush{\&}{\#}x2013;rail interfaces can be observed. This is typical in dynamic experiments when the current commutates from one brush to another. The experiments are discussed with the help of PSPICE simulations.},

The notional concept includes a 15 kg projectile with a 2.5 km/sec muzzle velocity. The choice of bore and rail geometry for such a weapon can influence key aspects of the total system design. This study explored a range of bore and rail geometries and looked at their effects on key railgun system parameters such as parasitic mass, inductance gradient, linear current density, required pulse forming network (PFN) size, and barrel mass. Preliminary solid modeling and structural analysis of the integrated launch package was performed in order to quantify parasitic mass. Inductance gradient calculations were based on a current density distribution analysis. A PFN/Launcher numerical simulation model was then used to determine linear current density and PFN size. Finally, barrel mass was estimated by structural analysis based on calculated rail repulsive forces. Trends and sensitivities of the different parameters to changes in the bore and rail geometries are presented and conclusions are given.},

The recent European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) grid codes on requirements for generators with the focus on frequency regulation are considered in the study. Rotor-side converter (RSC) control of the DFIG is developed to provide positive or negative active power reserve when a sudden change in frequency occurs. The study shows that, DFIGs are not only capable of changing their active power outputs during frequency deviations but their rotor inertia can also contribute to the grid frequency stability via introducing a derivative frequency controller and rotor speed reference setting. Therefore, the role which the conventional synchronous generators play during a system disturbance, can be delegated to them. The developed method is verified on IEEE 39-bus system including 10 conventional power plants using PowerFactory DIgSILENT software.},

abstract = {The French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis (ISL) has a long tradition in experimental research on the topic of electromagnetic acceleration using railguns. The main focus of this research is on the military application of these potent accelerators. At the ISL several railguns with different calibers are routinely used in experiments. The most powerful of these is the 10-MJ PEGASUS railgun. This railgun is a 6 m long accelerator with a square caliber of 40mm. It is making use of a distributed power supply (DES) scheme, connecting 200 capacitor modules to the gun. These modules are equipped with semiconducting switches and a current of up to 2 MA is delivered to the first 4 m of the barrel length. Since several years this launcher is employed in a study, accelerating newly designed payload projectiles. At the same time, the primary energy being used during the experiments is increased, with the final goal to fully utilize the installed 10 MJ. In the experiments being reported here, a major shift in the projectile design took place. For many years, industrial glass-fiber reinforced plastic (GRP) for the projectile body and metal-fiber brushes for the current conduction were used. Due to mechanical problems (delamination) during acceleration of the GRP projectile body to velocities above 2 km/s, parts of the body were replaced by aluminum. This changed not only the mechanical, but also the electrical behavior of the projectile during launch. Here results and experiences made with separating payload projectiles being equipped with an aluminum “booster” are reported. With an energy of 5MJ, velocities above 2 km/s were reached.},

abstract = {In grid-connected LCL-filtered inverters, the dual-loop current control is widely used. The LCL resonance is highly damped by proper feedback of the capacitor current. To suppress low-frequency current harmonics, a grid-voltage feedforward is commonly used. However, the system performance with such control is declined when connecting to a weak grid. Phase and gain margins are largely reduced while the proportional feedforward is used. The margins get worse and instability is aroused if the derivative feedforward is further implemented. Besides, a negative impact on the rejection of grid-voltage-induced harmonics is produced. To improve the control performance in the weak grid case, an adaptive control has been proposed. Adopting the estimated grid impedance, the signal for the grid-voltage feedforward is modified and the controller is adjusted with an adaptive rule to maintain a good phase margin or a high bandwidth. Performances of the inverter with the typical and the proposed methods are compared. Simulation and experimental results have demonstrated that the grid-connected LCL-filtered inverter with the proposed method produced a high-quality current while large grid impedance existed.},

However, the un-modeled dynamics, the eventual mistakes and the strong nonlinearity diminish the motor performance quality. Indeed, since its synthesis is based on heuristic knowledge, linguistic description to perform a task and does not require a system model, the fuzzy logic control (FLC) idea is successfully applied to motor systems. Despite these advantages, the occurrence of failure may dramatically degrade the system performance and may even result in catastrophic system collapse. Therefore, in order to overcome with the above drawbacks in this study a new fault tolerant control (FTC) structure based FLC is designed to improve PMSM drives currents and speed controls during healthy and faulty conditions.

abstract = { Failure of electromagnetic launch (EML) solid armatures can be caused by various mechanisms, but a critical performance limit is due to arcing at the rail/armature contact surface above the transition velocity. A previous theoretical transition model based on velocity skin effect and current wave (VSE/CW) phenomena is reviewed and further data of the changing current distribution at the contact surface is derived as the vaporization current wave moves forward until the arcing transition occurs. This VSE/CW model predicts experimental transition velocities with reasonable accuracy over a wide range of parameters (bore size from 15 to 90 mm). To achieve the required contact pressure distribution with the optimum contact region geometry, monolithic armatures are considered to be necessary, which is consistent with the highest transition velocities being achieved with such aluminum alloy armatures. Possible improvements in the performance of solid armatures are evaluated for monolithic armatures with copper rails by optimizing armature geometry, dimensions, contact pressure distribution, and the use of resistive contact region materials. An increase of {\textgreater}40{\%} in transition velocity to {\textgreater}2.5 km/s is predicted above reported experimental results.},

armature thickness to armature width named beta, and ratio of armature
height to armature width named., equations of some key parameters of
rectangular caliber railgun system, which is related to linear current
density, are proposed. Then, some key parameters for different caliber
railgun system are studied. Based on the analysis of electromagnetic
contact pressure between armature and rail, +di/dt skin effect, velocity
skin effect, and melt wear of armature, it can be obtained that current
density of rail/armature interface is directly proportional to the
linear current density. Thus, in order to decrease rail/armature
interface current density, it is necessary to reduce linear current
density. It can also be obtained that current density of rail/armature
interface in current ramp-up is inversely proportional to the root of
current rise time. Thus, it is necessary to increase current rise time
to decrease rail/armature interface current density. Average melt wear
rate of armature is directly proportional to the square of linear
current density.},

abstract = {A variety of techniques are available to reduce cogging torque in permanent-magnet brushless DC motors. Theoretically, all the techniques are quite effective for minimizing the cogging torque. This paper presents the efficacy of these methods in mass production subject to manufacturing tolerances/variations. The cogging torque minimization becomes a challenging task when the requirement is very stringent in applications such as electric power steering and robotics. Some of the known techniques for reducing the cogging torque are the magnet pole design, skewing, step skewing, and dummy slots in the stator lamination. They will be discussed in this paper considering manufacturing tolerances/variations when used in mass production. Finite-element analysis is carried out to determine the worst case scenarios. The research demonstrates that the cogging torque amplitude and frequency are highly sensitive to magnet shapes, dimensions, locations and magnetization pattern, as well as slot/pole combination. In reality, the cogging torque may not be eliminated completely but minimized to a satisfactory level depending on the application requirements.},

The sensitivity of GaN/AlGaN HEMTs to 1.8 MeV proton irradiation is greatly enhanced by biasing the devices during irradiation and/or applying high field stress before irradiation. The resulting defect energy distributions are evaluated after irradiation and/or high field stress via low-frequency noise measurements. Significant increases are observed in acceptor densities for defects with sim 0.2 and sim 0.7 eV energy levels. These defects appear to dominate the degradation in threshold voltage and transconductance for these devices. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that N vacancy-related defects in GaN and hydrogenated complexes in AlGaN are strong candidates for the defects with sim 0.2 eV energy levels in these devices. We also present evidence that the previously unidentified 0.7 eV defect in GaN is a N anti-site defect (NGa).},

abstract = {For a current controlled grid-connected inverter, the grid voltage distortion will give rise to the injected grid current harmonics. Besides, for the three-phase grid-connected inverter, under the unbalanced grid voltage condition, the injected grid currents will become unbalanced. This paper aims at weakening the effect of the grid voltages on the injected grid currents for a three-phase grid-connected inverter with an LCL filter. The full-feedforward scheme of the grid voltages is investigated in this paper. The full-feedforward function of the grid voltages in the stationary {\&}{\#}x03B1;-{\&}{\#}x03B2; frame for a three-phase grid-connected inverter with an LCL filter is proposed. This full-feedforward function consists of three parts, which is proportional part, derivative part and second derivative part. With the proposed full-feedforward scheme of the grid voltages, approximately zero steady-state error of the injected grid currents at line frequency can be achieved even with proportional-integral (PI) compensators as the injected grid current regulators in the stationary {\&}{\#}x03B1;-{\&}{\#}x03B2; frame. The injected grid current distortion and unbalance caused by the grid voltages are also greatly reduced. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed full-feedforward scheme is verified by the experimental results.},

The basic concepts, operating principles, control diagrams, and results are used to provide a comparison between the different control strategies. The analysis is performed on a traditional three-phase voltage source inverter, used as a simple and comprehensive reference frame. However, additional topologies and power systems are addressed to highlight differences, potentialities, and challenges of FCS-MPC. Among the conclusions are the feasibility and great potential of FCS-MPC due to present-day signal-processing capabilities, particularly for power systems with a reduced number of switching states and more complex operating principles, such as matrix converters. In addition, the possibility to address different or additional control objectives easily in a single cost function enables a simple, flexible, and improved performance controller for power-conversion systems.},

Then, possible future generator systems are reviewed. Hydraulic transmissions are significantly lighter than gearboxes and enable continuously variable transmission, but their efficiency is lower. A brushless DFIG is a medium speed generator without brushes and with improved low-voltage ride-through characteristics compared with the DFIG. Magnetic pseudo DDs are smaller and lighter than DD generators, but need a sufficiently low and stable magnet price to be successful. In addition, superconducting generators can be smaller and lighter than normal DD generators, but both cost and reliability need experimental demonstration.

This is a complex task: besides the large amplitudes of the in-bore magnetic fields due to the pulsed current, the exit of the projectile from the muzzle and the consequences of plasma arcs have to be considered. At the muzzle the magnetic induction can drop from several Teslas to zero within some microseconds, leading to very high induced voltages and electric fields in the metallic parts of the projectile. On the other hand, the electric contact established by solid armatures tends to develop into electric arcs at high velocities during the launch. These plasma arcs as well as the closing switch transients of the railgun circuit are a source of electromagnetic radiation in a broad spectral range. Some electronic devices were selected and tested with static setups corresponding to the previous conditions. In a first phase a series of static railgun experiments (no projectile movement) was performed. In a second phase, static experiments simulating the muzzle exit conditions were carried out. Finally, the influence of electromagnetic waves emitted during railgun experiments on electronic devices was investigated, using a static setup with a conventional spark gap.},

A novel electrical design method for this concept has been developed that can be also applied to conventional generators with copper coil and permanent magnet (PM) excitation with some modifications. Using the modified design program, electrical designs of 10-MW synchronous WTGs with HTS coil, copper coil, and PM excitation are conducted, and the influence of machine parameters (such as magnetic flux density in rotor iron cores, pole pitch, and stator outer diameter) on the basic generator performance is clarified. Based on these results, the optimized designs of three kinds of WTGs rotating at the low speeds of 8 min(-1) and 10 min(-1) are performed, and their basic performance is studied.},

abstract = {This paper presents a generalize model of ohmic contacts and a unified approach for the accurate extraction of specific contact resistivity ( pc) for ohmic contacts from measured contact resistance using the cross bridge Kelvin resistor, the contact end resistor, and the tranmsission line tap resistor test structures. A general three-dimensional (3-D) model of the contacts has been developed from the first principles and has been reduced to 2-D, 1-D, and 0-D (one lump) models with the necessary approximations. It is shown that the conventional 1-D models overestimate the value of pc because of the parasitic resistance due to 2-D current flow around the periphery of the contact window. Using 2-D simulations, we have accurately modeled the current crowding effects and have extracted accurate values of pc independent of contact size and the test structure type. A theory of scaling of contacts has been developed and is applied to commonly used structures. A universal set of curves has been derived for each particular contact resistance test structure and, given the geometry of the structure, these allow accurate determination of pc without the actual use of the 2-D simulator. Experimental and theoretical accuracy of the three test structures has been compared. Accurate values of pc for various contact materials to n+ and p+ Si have been determined. The data confirm that in the past researchers have overestimated pc, and that pc will not limit device performance even with submicrometer design rules.},

abstract = {A concept is presented along with the overarching structure of the virtual power plant (VPP), the primary vehicle for delivering cost efficient integration of distributed energy resources (DER) into the existing power systems. The growing pressure, primarily driven by environmental concerns, for generating more electricity from renewables and improving energy efficiency have promoted the application of DER into electricity systems. So far, DER have been used to displace energy from conventional generating plants but not to displace their capacity as they are not visible to system operators. If this continues, this will lead to problematic over-capacity issues and under- utilisation of the assets, reduce overall system efficiency and eventually increase the electricity cost that needs to be paid by society. The concept of VPP was developed to enhance the visibility and control of DER to system operators and other market actors by providing an appropriate interface between these system components. The technical and commercial functionality facilitated through the VPP are described and concludes with case studies demonstrating the benefit of aggregation (VPP concept) and the use of the optimal power flow algorithm to characterise VPP.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new predictive direct torque control (DTC) method is proposed, which improves the dynamic response of the conventional DTC in the transient state and yields the minimum torque and flux ripples in the steady state through an optimal voltage vector. At the steady state, the magnitude, phase, and time duration of the voltage vector are adjusted in a manner where the minimum torque and flux ripples are obtained; whereas in the transient state, the voltage vector parameters are adjusted in a manner where the fastest dynamic response is achieved. The space-vector modulation is used in synthesizing the selected voltage vector where a fixed switching frequency is achieved. In order to improve the control system efficiency, the principle of maximum torque per ampere is adopted in obtaining the commanding stator flux magnitude. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the steady-state and transient-state performances are tested in MATLAB software and in practice. The simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed method yields the minimum torque and flux ripples while improving the dynamic response of the conventional DTC. The comparative investigation with an existing predictive DTC method indicates that the proposed method has a better performance in both the steady state and transient state.},

abstract = {A dynamic particle swarm optimization with learning strategy (DPSO-LS) is proposed for key parameter estimation for permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs), where the voltage-source inverter (VSI) nonlinearities are taken into account in the parameter estimation model and can be estimated simultaneously with other machine parameters. In the DPSO-LS algorithm, a novel movement modification equation with variable exploration vector is designed to effectively update particles, enabling swarms to cover large areas of search space with large probability and thus the global search ability is enhanced. Moreover, a Gaussian-distribution-based dynamic opposition-based learning strategy is developed to help the pBest jump out local optima. The proposed DPSO-LS can significantly enhance the estimator model accuracy and dynamic performance. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to multiple parameter estimation including the VSI nonlinearities of a PMSM. The performance of DPSO-LS is compared with several existing PSO algorithms, and the comparison results show that the proposed parameters estimation method has better performance in tracking the variation of machine parameters effectively and estimating the VSI nonlinearities under different operation conditions.},

abstract = {Distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) is one of the well-known and effective strategies adopted in distribution network. The goal of DFR problem is to obtain a new topological structure for distribution feeders by rearranging the status of switches such that an optimal configuration would be obtained. The existence of Distributed Generation (DG) can affect the entire power system and especially distribution networks. This paper presents an efficient approach for multi-objective DFR problem considering the simultaneous effect of DG units. The objective functions to be investigated are 1) power losses, 2) voltage deviation of buses, 3) emission produced by DG units and distribution companies and 4) the total cost of the active power generated by DG units and distribution companies. The new evolutionary method is based on an efficient multi-objective hybrid honey bee mating optimization (HBMO) and shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) called MHBMO-SFLA. The proposed hybrid algorithm integrates the outstanding characteristics of SFLA to improve the performance of HBMO algorithm sufficiently. In the proposed MHBMO-SFLA, an external repository is considered to save non-dominated solutions which are found during the search process. Also, since the objective functions are not the same, a fuzzy clustering technique is utilized to control the size of the repository within the limits. A distribution test feeder is considered to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} Shiraz University.},

The typical current clustering phenomena in static conductors are classified, and the physical principle of VSE is analyzed for rail and armature respectively in this paper. The physical principle in rails is just Skin Effect because of the short risetime of the accepted pulse current, and the physical principle in armature is Clustering Near Small Source (CNSS) and Clustering Along Short Path (CASP) of steady current owing to the continuity characteristic or the voltage drop. An equivalent steady 3-dimension model has been proposed and adopted, and the quantitative distributions of current for U-shaped and cuboid armatures are simulated contrastively by Maxwell 14.0. The simulation results reveal that the current in the interface trends to cluster along the rear perimeter, and the U-shaped armature is superior to the cuboid armature.

There have been relatively few studies presented or published on the effects of radiation on this device technology. The S-O-A knowledge of UMOS power device degradation and failure under heavy-ion exposure is reviewed.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the design of a brushless exciter for a hybrid permanent magnet (HPM) generator for application in series hybrid electric vehicles (SHEV). The brushless exciter has a 36-pole stator winding and multi-phase rotor configuration that supplies the HPM wound field (WF) rotor via a rotating rectifier. The brushless exciter rotor components are all assembled on the same shaft as the HPM generator rotor. The HPM machine is engine mounted and has to accommodate a through shaft. This forms one of the constraints on the HPM generator and brushless exciter design. Moreover, to minimize component count the brushless exciter design is constrained to use the same laminations as those used in the HPM generator. A multi- phase design approach is used for the brushless exciter rotor that, together with an uncontrolled passive rectifier, delivers a high quality DC output to the HPM WF. This eliminates the necessity for passive smoothing of the rectified DC output and hence improves the reliability of the system. Dynamic behaviour of the brushless exciter is analysed to examine the response and effectiveness of the proposed design.},

The designed slotted TORUS motor produces sinusoidal back-EMF waveform, maximum power density, and reduced cogging torque. The GA obtained the dimensions of motors with different numbers of slots and the highest possible power density. Electromagnetic field analysis of the candidate motors obtained from GA with various dimensions is subjected through FEA to obtain the motors' characteristics. Based on the GA and FEA results, a candidate motor design is introduced and subjected to FEA for reoptimization and finalization of the motor design. Techniques like modifying winding configuration and permanent magnet skewing are investigated to attain the most sinusoidal back-EMF waveform and reduced cogging torque. FEA and GA simulation results are compared and agreed well to the flux density in various areas of the designed motor at no-load condition. The final designed motor (1 kW, 50 Hz, four poles) is fabricated and tested. Experimental results agree with those of the simulation, both satisfying the desired technical specifications.},

abstract = {An electromagnetic railgun is one of the applications of electromagnetic launchers, which are devices used to accelerate projectiles to velocities exceeding those attained with conventional propelling systems. A magnetic field is generated when current flows through two conductive rails connected by a moving armature. The current that passes through the rails exerts an electromagnetic force on the armature and causes it to accelerate to high speeds. In this work, a three-dimensional transient model for the thermal and electromagnetic solutions of the launch process is presented. The model accounts for the determination of the current and temperature profiles inside the rails, the projectile movement, and the cooling process after the first launch. Focus is given to the thermal management where five different arrangements, one without cooling and four that include cooling channels, are studied. A 10 to 50K reduction in the peak temperature was obtained with the inclusion of cooling channels when compared to the no-cooling-channel case. It was also shown that the position and size of these channels can be optimized in order to reduce this peak temperature.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This paper presents an overview of motor drive technologies used for safety-critical aerospace applications, with a particular focus placed on the choice of candidate machines and their drive topologies. Aircraft applications demand high reliability, high availability, and high power density while aiming to reduce weight, complexity, fuel consumption, operational costs, and environmental impact. New electric driven systems can meet these requirements and also provide significant technical and economic improvements over conventional mechanical, hydraulic, or pneumatic systems. Fault-tolerant motor drives can be achieved by partitioning and redundancy through the use of multichannel three-phase systems or multiple single-phase modules. Analytical methods are adopted to compare caged induction, reluctance, and PM motor technologies and their relative merits. The analysis suggests that the dual (or triple) three-phase PMAC motor drive may be a favored choice for general aerospace applications, striking a balance between necessary redundancy and undue complexity, while maintaining a balanced operation following a failure. The modular single-phase approach offers a good compromise between size and complexity but suffers from high total harmonic distortion of the supply and high torque ripple when faulted. For each specific aircraft application, a parametrical optimization of the suitable motor configuration is needed through a coupled electromagnetic and thermal analysis, and should be verified by finite-element analysis.},

abstract = {—Power electronics is an enabling technology found in most renewable energy generation systems. Because of its superior voltage blocking capabilities and fast switching speeds, silicon carbide (SiC) power electronics are considered for use in power conversion units in wind generation systems in this paper. The potential efficiency gains from the use of SiC devices in a wind gen-eration system are explored by simulations, with the system mod-eling explained in detail. The performance of the SiC converter is analyzed and compared to its silicon counterpart at different wind speeds, temperatures, and switching frequencies. The quantitative results are based on SiC metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) prototypes from Cree and modern Si in-sulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) products. A conclusion is drawn that the SiC converters can improve the wind system power conversion efficiency and can reduce the system's size and cost due to the low-loss, high-frequency, and high-temperature properties of SiC devices, even for one-for-one replacement for Si devices.

The optimal torque control is adopted to guarantee the ripple-free electromagnetic torque operation for the ten-phase motor system under the post-fault condition. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the load capacity of the ten-phase motor system under different fault modes. And a torque limitation control approach based on the fault mode is proposed, which was not available earlier. This approach is able to ensure the safety operation of the faulted motor system in long operating time without causing the overheat fault. The simulation result confirms that the proposed fault tolerant control for the ten-phase motor system is able to guarantee the ripple-free electromagnetic torque and the safety operation in long operating time under the normal and fault conditions.},

abstract = {The electrical frequency of an interconnection must be maintained very close to its nominal level at all times. Excessive frequency deviations can lead to load shedding, instability, machine damage, and even blackouts. There is rising concern in the power industry in recent years about the declining amount of inertia and primary frequency response (PFR) in many interconnections. This decline may continue due to increasing penetrations of inverter-coupled generation and the planned retirements of conventional thermal plants. Inverter-coupled variable wind generation is capable of contributing to PFR and inertia; however, wind generation PFR and inertia responses differ from those of conventional generators, and it is not entirely understood how this will affect the system at different wind power penetration levels. The simulation work presented in this paper evaluates the impact of the wind generation provision of these active power control strategies on a large, synchronous interconnection. All simulations were conducted on the U.S. Western Interconnection with different levels of wind power penetration levels. The ability of wind power plants to provide PFR–and a combination of synthetic inertial response and PFR–significantly improved the frequency response performance of the system. The simulation results provide insight to designing and operating wind generation active power controls to facilitate adequate frequency response performance of an interconnection.},

abstract = {The influence of selected control strategies on the level of low-order current harmonic distortion generated by an inverter connected to a distorted grid is investigated through a combination of theoretical and experimental studies. A detailed theoretical analysis, based on the concept of harmonic impedance, establishes the suitability of inductor current feedback versus output current feedback with respect to inverter power quality. Experimental results, obtained from a purpose-built 500-W, three-level, half-bridge inverter with an L-C-L output filter, verify the efficacy of inductor current as the feedback variable, yielding an output current total harmonic distortion (THD) some 29{\%} lower than that achieved using output current feedback. A feed-forward grid voltage disturbance rejection scheme is proposed as a means to further reduce the level of low-order current harmonic distortion. Results obtained from an inverter with inductor current feedback and optimized feed-forward disturbance rejection show a THD of just 3{\%} at full-load, representing an improvement of some 53{\%} on the same inverter with output current feedback and no feed-forward compensation. Significant improvements in THD were also achieved across the entire load range. It is concluded that the use of inductor current feedback and feed-forward voltage disturbance rejection represent cost-effect mechanisms for achieving improved output current quality.},

abstract = {The rapidly developing wind power industry demands high power generators. Direct driven permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), which has the advantages of high drive train efficiency and high reliability, is promising in wind turbine applications, especially offshore. It is known, that direct driven PMSG is heavier than its geared counterparts, which increases the cost and may bring up engineering challenges. Integrating the active parts of PMSG with the blades, hub or nacelle and sharing the carrying structures can give considerable reduction of the top head mass. Integrated design challenges the electromagnetic and thermal analysis of PMSG from the perspective of whole system and the design approach may differ from the conventional. This paper presents an overview of the modeling methods for the design of PMSG. First, the drive train technology is discussed and challenges in the design of PMSG are identified. Secondly, the electromagnetic and thermal design methods are reviewed. Finally, development of simulation software is investigated.},

abstract = {During the past few decades, various calculation models have been
introduced into studying solid armature railgun. In this paper, four
models, including constant resistance, speed resistance, current
resistance, and multifactor resistance, were studied in detail. To
verify their validity, experimental and simulation methods were adopted
in both low-and high-velocity cases. By conducting a 3-D eddy current
electromagnetic field simulation with the finite-element numerical
method, the self-inductance gradient (L-r') was got. The control
equations of these different resistance models can be solved by the
Runge-Kutta method. Comparisons of experimental and simulation results
of these different resistance models indicated that an appropriate
resistance model according to the experimental condition can improve the
accuracy of simulation analysis. The friction coefficient resistance
model can describe armature resistance during the movement process in
both low-and high-velocity cases.},

abstract = {This paper outlines the design procedure for a permanent-magnet (PM) wind generator, which is optimized for energy capture over a wide operating range (i.e. a range of speeds and loads). This is achieved by using an optimisation routine to find the permutation of generator design variables, which maximises its energy capture when operated through the normal operating regions of a variable speed wind turbine. In so doing, the efficiency vs. speed curve of the generator is shaped to produce a high average efficiency over the operating range of the turbine. This is in direct contrast to conventional machine design methods of producing a high absolute efficiency at a single operating point (i.e. rated speed and load)},

abstract = {The conventional XRAM (MARX spelled backwards) current multiplier$\backslash$ncircuit is similar in concept to the better known MARX voltage multiplier$\backslash$ncircuit. In the MARX circuit, capacitors charged in parallel from$\backslash$na voltage source are switched to discharge in series producing an$\backslash$noutput voltage approximately equal to the sum of individual capacitor$\backslash$nvoltages. In the XRAM circuit, inductors energized in series from$\backslash$na current source (battery, homopolar generator, other) are switched$\backslash$nto discharge in parallel, producing an output current which is the$\backslash$nsum of the individual inductor currents. In high energy pulsed power$\backslash$nsystems these multiplier techniques simplify primary power design$\backslash$nat the expense of more complex switching. The hybrid XRAM circuit$\backslash$ndescribed in this paper minimizes switching requirements while retaining$\backslash$nthe positive benefits of the conventional XRAM circuit. It also provides$\backslash$na smooth rising current waveform which is useful for EM and ET gun$\backslash$nresearch. The tradeoff for these benefits is that, during switching,$\backslash$napproximately 50{\%} of total system energy is stored in a capacitor$\backslash$nbank of simple design. In addition to simplified switching, the hybrid$\backslash$nconcept offers other advantages over either an all capacitive or$\backslash$nall inductive system. As a laboratory power supply at 2-3 MA current$\backslash$nand 10-20 MJ stored energy, it doubles energy which would be available$\backslash$nfrom a capacitive system while offering the current ''stiffness'$\backslash$navailable from an inductive system. Less obvious but potentially$\backslash$nof greater interest, the concept appears to scale to high energy$\backslash$n(10's to 100's of MJ) for either a distributed energy or multi shot$\backslash$npower supply. This paper outlines two XRAM circuit concepts, and$\backslash$ndiscusses the distributed energy and multi-shot aspects of the hybrid$\backslash$nconcept. It also describes a more detailed study of a battery powered$\backslash$nhybrid XRAM current doubler design being considered for use as a$\backslash$ngeneral purpose laboratory inductive energy supply, operating at$\backslash$nup to 2.5 MA with as much as 10 MJ of electrical energy stored. The$\backslash$ncircuit described is modeled using known values from existing circuit$\backslash$ncomponents. Resulting waveforms are shown and benefits derived from$\backslash$nthe use of this circuit are compared to those from a conventional$\backslash$nXRAM current doubler as well as from a direct, inductive store, system$\backslash$ndesign.},

abstract = {Most railgun experiments exhibit transition to high-voltage contact after the applied current starts to decrease from its peak value. A statistical examination of existing data revealed that such contact transitions occur at approximately 80{\%} of peak current during down-slope. While several plausible explanations exist for the cause of such transition, we demonstrate through numerical simulation that a likely cause of this transition mechanism is a diffusion-controlled process that reduces the contact pressure below the threshold value necessary to carry the applied current. The current down-slope was found to result in a nonuniform body-force-density distribution in the armature such that the contact pressure at the armature-rail interface decreases (eventually becoming zero) even though the total electromagnetic force resulting from the applied current is still compressive. This event's diffusive nature suggests that transition can be delayed by controlling the diffusion time, either by judicious material grading or increasing the diffusion depth},

abstract = {Data from the ITRS2003 roadmap for 2010 predicts voltages for microprocessors in hand-held electronics will decrease to 0.8V with current and power increasing to 4A and 3W, respectively. Consequently, low power converters will move to multimegahertz frequencies with a resulting reduction in capacitor and inductor values by factors of 5 and 20, respectively. Values required at 10 MHz, for a low power buck converter, are estimated at 130 nH and 0.6 uF, compatible with the integration of magnetics onto silicon and the concept of power supply-on-chip (PSOC). A review of magnetics-on-silicon shows that inductance values of 20 to 40nH/mm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} can be achieved for winding resistances less than 1{\&}Omega;. A 1-{\&}mu;H inductance can be achieved at 5 MHz with dc resistance of 1{\&}Omega; and a Q of four. Thin film magnetic materials, compatible with semiconductor processing, offer power loss density that is lower than ferrite by a factor of 5 at 10 MHz. Other data reported includes, lowest dc resistance values of 120 m{\&}Omega; for an inductance of 120 nH; highest Q of 15 for an inductance of 350 nH and a current of 1 A for a 1- {\&}mu;H inductor. Future technology challenges include reducing losses using high resistivity, laminated magnetic materials, and increasing current carrying capability using high aspect-ratio, electroplated copper conductors. Compatible technologies are available in the power switch, control, and packaging space.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. This paper analyzes the problem of instability in enhancement-mode gallium nitride (GaN) transistors based half-bridge circuits. The instability may cause sustained oscillation, resulting in overvoltage, excessive electromagnetic interference (EMI), and even device breakdown. GaN devices operate in the saturation region when they conduct reversely during the dead time. Under the influence of parasitic parameters, the GaN-based half-bridge circuit exhibits positive feedback under certain conditions, thus, resulting in sustained oscillation. A small-signal model is proposed to study this positive feedback phenomenon. Like the second-order under-damped system, damping ratio is defined to determine the system's stability. Based on the model, the influence of circuit parameters on instability is investigated and guidelines to suppress the oscillation are given. Reducing the co mmon-source inductance, increasing the gate resistance of the inactive switch or connecting a diode in parallel to the inactive switch are some effective ways to suppress the oscillation. Finally, the analyses are verified by both simulation and experiment.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE. Gallium Nitride enhancement-mode high electron mobility transistors (GaN E-HEMTs) can achieve relatively high-efficiency and high-frequency in hard-switching mode. One particular reason is that GaN E-HEMTs obtain zero reverse-recovery loss and also a zero reverse-recovery period. For silicon (Si) MOSFETs, it has been a well-known issue that their Qrris too big to switch the transistor in hard-switching mode. Researchers have made extensive efforts to calculate the reverse-recovery loss. However, few of them pay attention to the Qoss, as the Qrrdominates in the turn-on switching loss for Si MOSFETs. For GaN HEMTs, the absence of the Qrrmakes the Qossnoticeable, although the value of the Qossfor GaN HEMTs is still the smallest among both Si and Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFETs. This paper focus on the Eqoss loss in GaN HEMTs. The Eqoss loss mechanism, detailed calculation and detailed measurement method for GaN HEMTs are provided. In addition, the theoretical results are verified by the double-pulse test at different junction temperatures and gate resistances.},

This project began at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the Fall of 1995, and later expanded through collaborations with the Georgia Institute of Technology, the Clark Atlanta University, and the University of Maryland at College Park.  The overall objective of the Micro Engine Project was to develop a small but power-dense gas turbine generator based on MEMS fabrication technologies. Thus, the project sought to develop a fuel-burning jet engine that would drive an electric generator to produce electric power for general purpose use.  Along the way, the project would advance the science and engineering of many disciplines from the MEMS perspective.  The Micro Engine Project was by its very nature a highly mult-disciplinary project pursuing advances in materials, structures, fabrication, combustion, heat transfer, turbomachinery, bearings and electromechanics, all at the MEMS scale.  Many of these topics are addressed in this volume, including:    materials structures and packaging multi-wafer MEMS fabrication and and bonding technologiesElectroplating magnetic components electroplating magnetic structures into silicon very-high-speed air bearings thermofluids and turbomachinery electric and magnetic generators combustion    About The MEMs Reference Shelf:  'The MEMs Reference Shelf is a series devoted to Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMs) which combine mechanical, electrical, optical, or fluidic elements on a common microfabricated substrate to create sensors, actuators, and microsystems.

abstract = {With rapid electrification of transportation, it is becoming increasingly important to have a comprehensive understanding of criteria used in motor selection. This paper presents the design and comparative evaluation for an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) with distributed winding and concentrated winding, induction motor (IM), and switched reluctance motor (SRM) for an electric vehicle (EV) or hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) application. A fast finite element analysis (FEA) modeling approach is addressed for IM design. To account for highly nonlinear motor parameters and achieve high motor efficiency, optimal current trajectories are obtained by extensive mapping for IPMSMs and IM. Optimal turn-on and turn-off angles with current chopping control and angular position control are found for SRM. Additional comparison including noise vibration and harshness (NVH) is also highlighted. Simulation and analytical results show that each motor topology demonstrates its own unique characteristic for EVs/HEVs. Each motor's highest efficiency region is located at different torque-speed regions for the criteria defined. Stator geometry, pole/slot combination, and control strategy differentiate NVH performance.},

Solid armatures overcome this factor but perform less well as velocities increase. Many types of solid armature have been tried, including metal fibers and magnetic obturator types, but the classic "C" type remains the armature of choice for high-velocity projectile launches. The recovery of fired armatures at the Kirkcudbright range has allowed many of these ideas to be formulated. This paper looks at what happens to "C" types, explains the basic processes occurring as the armature gains velocity, and identifies the limitations of this design. It offers suggestions for improving performance, including materials and design options, with outline results in some areas, and offers some design characteristics to be considered with this classic armature shape. Comparison with alternative armature concepts is briefly made so as to present an overall view.},

abstract = {The Current Controlled Voltage Source Inverter (CCVSI) has attracted substantial research due to its common application for the integration of renewable energy resources into the main grid. The single loop current controller is commonly used in industry for CCVSI due to its simplicity, desirable stability margins and dynamic performance. For the single loop controller, the point of common coupling (PCC) voltage feedforward control is used to improve the transient and disturbance rejection performance. However, this solution exhibits one drawback that has not yet been adequately discussed in the literature: the poor stability caused by the feedforward control itself. It is proved that the feedforward voltage results in a “positive feedback control” which essentially degrades the stability of the system and its control performance. Since the gain of the “positive feedback control” depends on the grid impedance, it is necessary to study how the stability and control performance of the grid parallel inverter is affected by the feedforward control under various grid impedances. The system without feedforward control is also investigated due the fact that the grid impedance generally affects the system stability. The analytical study shows that two cases have similar performance under stiff grid, while the case without feedforward has superior stability and control performance under weak grid impedance. The simulation and experimental results also validate the outcome of the analytical study.},

The experimental setup consisted of a charge loop to simulate a solar collector input, three commercially available 270. L domestic hot water tanks and three side-arm, natural convection heat exchangers. Tests were performed over 8. h periods for three different plumbing configurations and two different hourly draw volumes. Simulations were conducted using the TRNSYS simulation environment, and the results showed that the TRNSYS model was in good agreement with the experimental results, where the discrepancies between data were found mainly in the regions of high temperature gradients within the storage tanks. Preliminary simulations were also conducted using realistic charge and draw profiles to illustrate the thermal behaviour of the tanks under non-ideal operating conditions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, a simple and accurate circuit- simulator compact model for gallium nitride (GaN) high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) is proposed and validated under both static and switching conditions. A novel feature of this model is that it is valid also in the third quadrant, which is important when the device operates as a freewheeling diode. The only measurements required for the parameter extraction are simple I-V static characteristics and C-V characteristics. A double-pulse test-bench is built to characterize the resistive and inductive switching behavior of the GaN device. A simulation model is built in Pspice software tool, considering the parasitic elements from associated with the PCB interconnections and other components (load resistor, load inductor and current shunt monitor). The Pspice simulation results are compared with experimental results. The comparison shows good agreement between simulation and experimental results under both resistive and inductive switching conditions. Operation in the third quadrant under inductive switching is also validated. I.},

Problem-based learning (PBL), as a student-centered instructional approach, has contributed to important developments in engineering education over the last few years. This paper presents the experience of a problem-based learning approach within the context of teaching wind energy conversion systems for electricity generation at an Electrical and Electronic Master's degree level. Students were given the problem of finding the response of a wind turbine to a grid fault. Groups of three students worked on a cooperative learning project for 15 weeks, with the instructor providing resource assistance and information at all stages of the work. Two tools were designed to help the students: a virtual wind turbine simulator and a real wind turbine setup. Both experimental tools are described, and the results obtained by the students are discussed. The results show that the students valued both tools and were able to address problems at a high cognitive level.},

abstract = { Over the last two decades, several mechanisms of armature transition have been postulated. Each mechanism has been subjected to experimental and analytic examination with the objective of "explaining" transition. However, no single mechanism has emerged as the consensus cause of transition. In this paper, we take the position that all the mechanisms that have been identified, and perhaps others which have not yet been, contribute to and may be mutually influenced by those processes leading to the onset of transition. Our inability to correlate transition with a single mechanism, or model, results from the multiplicity of mechanisms at work. We examine all the mechanisms identified to date, suggest several additional ones, and explore a more complex transition world in which each transition event is potentially caused by a different mechanism or combination of mechanisms. With this picture, control of transition requires that we control all of the mechanisms which can result in transition, not just one.},

The goal of the control is to have the BESS to provide as much smoothing as possible, so that the wind farm can be dispatched on an hourly basis based on the forecasted wind conditions. The effectiveness of this control strategy has been tested by using an actual wind farm data. Furthermore, a real-time implementation strategy using model predictive control is also proposed. Finally, it is shown that the control strategy is very important in improving the BESS performance for this application.},

Essentials of the very simplest, two-dimensional theoretical railgun model are derived, with emphasis on its pertaining to the moving plasma frame. The necessary Lorentz transformation to the static rail frame is discussed, including its purely relativistic buildup of rail surface charge. This charge is proved to interact with the rail metal ion lattice in the rail electron current regions so as to provide, locally and globally, recoil acting on the rails, in agreement with observations. The main reason for poor railgun performance is attributed to lack of penetration depth into the rails for the recoil forces, resulting in rail surface damage rather than projectile acceleration. Two remedies are suggested: Hall conducting graphite rails or composite rails made of metal and ceramic},

abstract = {This paper investigates an improved active power control method for variable speed wind turbine to enhance the inertial response and damping capability during transient events. The optimized power point tracking (OPPT) controller, which shifts the turbine operating point from the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) curve to the virtual inertia control (VIC) curves according to the frequency deviation, is proposed to release the “hidden” kinetic energy and provide dynamic frequency support to the grid. The effects of the VIC on power oscillation damping capability are theoretically evaluated. Compared to the conventional supplementary derivative regulator-based inertia control, the proposed control scheme can not only provide fast inertial response, but also increase the system damping capability during transient events. Thus, inertial response and power oscillation damping function can be obtained in a single controller by the proposed OPPT control. A prototype three-machine system containing two synchronous generators and a PMSG-based wind turbine with 31{\%} of wind penetration is tested to validate the proposed control strategy on providing rapid inertial response and enhanced system damping.},

abstract = {This paper has two purposes: 1) to clarify the relationship between the quantum theory of radiation, where the electromagnetic field-expansion coefficients satisfy commutation relations, and the semiclassical theory, where the electromagnetic field is considered as a definite function of time rather than as an operator; and 2) to apply some of the results in a study of amplitude and frequency stability in a molecular beam maser. In 1), it is shown that the semiclassical theory, when extended te take into account both the effect of the field on the molecules and the effect of the molecules on the field, reproduces almost quantitatively the same laws of energy exchange and coherence properties as the quantized field theory, even in the limit of one or a few quanta in the field mode. In particular, the semiclassical theory is shown to lead to a prediction of spontaneous emission, with the same decay rate as given by quantum electrodynamics, described by the Einstein A coefficients. In 2), the semiclassical theory is applied to the molecular beam maser. Equilibrium amplitude and frequency of oscillation are obtained for an arbitrary velocity distribution of focused molecules, generalizing the results obtained previously by Gordon, Zeiger, and Townes for a singel-velocity beam, and by Lamb and Helmer for a Maxwellian beam. A somewhat surprising result is obtained; which is that the measurable properties of the maser, such as starting current, effective molecular Q, etc., depend mostly on the slowest 5 to 10 per cent of the molecules. Next we calculate the effect of amplitude and frequency of oscillation, of small systematic perturbations. We obtain a prediction that stability can be improved by adjusting the system so that the molecules emit all their energy h $\Omega$ to the field, then reabsorb part of it, before leaving the cavity. In general, the most stable operation is obtained when the molecules are in the process of absorbing energy from the radiation as they leave the cavity, most unstable when they are still emitting energy at that time. Finally, we consider the response of an oscillating maser to randomly time-varying perturbations. Graphs are given showing predicted response to a small superimposed signal of a frequency near the - oscillation frequency. The existence of "noise enhancing" and "noise quieting" modes of operation found here is a general property of any oscillating system in which amplitude is limited by nonlinearity.},

abstract = {One innovative approach for producing functionally graded tungsten/copper composites involves infiltrating a porous tungsten structure with molten copper. The porous structure is created by sintering tungsten powder to create an initial porous preform and then connecting the preform to the anode of an electrochemical cell. The porosity increases with time as the tungsten oxidizes in the alkaline electrolyte. The rate of porosity increase depends on the local value of electric-potential difference between the electrode and electrolyte, while the local electrical properties are a function of the porosity. Therefore, the porosity distribution, which determines the material-property gradient of the resulting material, can be modeled by a system of coupled equations describing porosity and electric potential. The present work develops a numerical tool capable of predicting the evolution of porosity in the rectangular-slab geometry (the extension to cylindrical-shell and elliptical-shell geometries is straightforward). Analysis of the results suggests that the shape of the gradient can be varied by adjusting parameters such as initial porosity and current density. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {With the development of more/all electrical aircraft technology, an electro-mechanical actuator (EMA) is more and more used in an aircraft actuation system. The motor system, as the crucial part of an EMA, usually adopts the redundancy technology or fault tolerance technology to improve the reliability. To compare the performances of these two motor systems, a 10-pole/12-slot six-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is designed with the concentrated single-layer winding, which is able to operate at dual-redundant and fault tolerant modes. Furthermore, the position servo performances of the six-phase PMSM at dual-redundant and fault tolerant modes are analyzed, including the normal and fault conditions. In addition, a variable structure proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control strategy is proposed to solve the performance degradation problem caused by phase current saturation. Simulation and experimental results show that the fault tolerant PMSM has a better position servo performance than the dual-redundant PMSM, and the variable structure PID control strategy is able to improve the performance due to phase current saturation.},

The goal of the control is to have the BESS to provide as much smoothing as possible, so that the wind farm can be dispatched on an hourly basis based on the forecasted wind conditions. The effectiveness of this control strategy has been tested by using an actual wind farm data. Furthermore, a real-time implementation strategy using model predictive control is also proposed. Finally, it is shown that the control strategy is very important in improving the BESS performance for this application.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a design method for stepped skewing of rotor magnets to selectively eliminate the harmonics of the no-load electromotive force (EMF) and the ripple torque, which is generated by the interaction of the stator cur-rent magnetomotive force with the rotor magnet flux distribution. The method is based on the theory that a harmonic component of the ripple torque is generated by the corresponding two harmonics of the no-load EMF. An elementary unit of the proposed skewing for canceling out one harmonic EMF consists of two identical magnet blocks skewed axially. For suppressing a harmonic ripple torque, the corresponding two harmonic EMFs are canceled out by skewing two identical elementary units or a four-step skewing. In the paper, the skew angle for canceling out each harmonic EMF is theoretically obtained. It is shown that one harmonic ripple torque is almost completely suppressed by the proposed four-step skewing through two-dimensional and three-dimensional finite element method (FEM) analyses. In addition, experiments are performed to confirm the selective elimination of one harmonic EMF and to validate the FEM analyses. By using the proposed method, a multiple-step skewing can be designed to simultaneously suppress more than one harmonic component of the ripple torque.},

abstract = {A concept of an integrated and distributed inverter for switched reluctance machines is introduced. The application at hand is an outer-rotor direct drive designed for railway traction applications. A five-phase switched reluctance machine was developed and is used to demonstrate the function of the integrated and distributed inverter. The distribution is achieved by supplying each phase coil with its own modular inverter. Each inverter module is placed evenly around the end of the stator stack next to its dedicated coil. This increases the redundancy of the drive significantly. The likelihood of phase-to-phase faults is reduced, because no overlapping end-turns are necessary. Also, the integration of machine and inverter is simplified, because the semiconductors can be evenly distributed around the machine. The concept reduces the amount of terminals between drive and vehicle to communication, power supply, and cooling, independent of the number of machine phases. With the integrated and distributed inverter new control strategies can be developed to influence machine vibration and radiated noise. In this paper, the design of the prototype, the direct torque control of the five-phase machine, and the behavior in the case of a fault inside a module is analyzed.},

abstract = {—To develop a reliable permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) controller for electric vehicle application, detec-tion of permanent-magnet (PM) demagnetization conditions is of significance. This paper explores the use of torque ripple for on-line PM demagnetization fault diagnosis using continuous wavelet transforms (CWT) and grey system theory (GST). First, a torque-ripple-based rotor flux linkage detection model considering electro-magnetic noises is proposed, which employs CWT filtering, wavelet ridge spectrum, and torque ripple energy extraction. This model is able to reveal the torque variation and eliminate the effect of elec-tromagnetic interferences. Second, GST is employed to facilitate the detection of demagnetization ratios and torque ripple energy pulsations caused by demagnetization. Third, a current regulation strategy is proposed to minimize the torque ripples induced by PM demagnetization, which contributes to making the approach feasi-ble to interior PMSM (IPMSM). Furthermore, the proposed real-time irreversible demagnetization detection approach can identify the demagnetization fault under different operating conditions. The proposed approach and current regulation strategy are exper-imentally verified on a down-scaled laboratory IPMSM.

All three parabolic differential equations are numerically solved according to a finite difference approach implemented in MATLAB language. The simulations are conducted in order to derive the temperature profiles inside the PCM and to estimate the time needed to complete the melting of the PCM.

Therefore, new control schemes are necessary for wind turbines and power systems to support the frequency control. Currently, most of the published control methods can be classified into 3 levels, i.e., wind turbine level, wind farm level and power system level. The wind turbine level control enables wind turbines, particularly the variable speed wind generators, to provide dynamic response and power reserves for the primary frequency control by implementing the inertial, droop or deloading controller. The wind farm level control distributes the central control command from the system to the local wind turbines and energy storage units for the desired generation. The power system level control coordinates wind farms with conventional power plants for the secondary control to recover the frequency to the reference value faster than for the no coordination control case. This paper presents a review on the latest studies in relation to the 3-level frequency control of power systems with wind power penetration.},

abstract = {This paper presents an analytical model for input, output, and reverse capacitance of a normally ON AlGaN/GaN high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) with a gate field-plate structure, when the device is in the subthreshold regime. Together with the existing model for the output I-V characteristics, the proposed capacitance model provides the complete set of analytical equations that relate the physical design parameters to the electrical characteristics of the device. The model was verified by the experimental characterization of a HEMT. In comparison to the physics-based models implemented in Finite Element Analysis tools, the obtained capacitance model has substantially lower level of complexity and, therefore, it is more suitable for implementation into iterative design optimization algorithms. In order to verify the proposed model for such usage, the prototype of a high-frequency buck converter was built, using previously modeled GaN HEMT as the main switch. The hybrid analytical-behavioral power loss model of a high-frequency buck converter was implemented into Simplorer simulation tool, using the proposed physics-based model as the device description for the capacitive part. The efficiency measurements showed good agreement with the simulation results, even at 20 MHz of switching frequency in the low range of the output power.},

abstract = {This thesis presents an investigation of how a direct-driven wind turbine generator should be designed and how small and efficient such a generator will be. Advantages and disadvantages of various types of direct-driven wind turbine generators are discussed, and a radial-flux permanent-magnet generator connected to a forced-commutated rectifier is chosen for a detailed theoretical investigation. Further, a design method is developed for the electromagnetic part of the chosen generator type. The generator is optimized with a simplified cost function which, besides including the cost of the active generator parts and the cost of the structure, also includes the cost of the average losses. Therefore, a method to calculate the average losses is derived. The design method is used to investigate the optimization of a 500 kW generator, and the size, efficiency and active weight of optimized generators from 30 kW to 3 MW are presented. A result of the investigation is that the outer diameters of the direct-driven generators are only slightly larger than the width of conventional wind energy converter nacelles. A comparison of average efficiency shows that direct-driven generators, including the losses in the frequency converters, are more efficient than conventional wind energy converter drive trains. Compared with other direct-driven generators, the proposed generator type is small, mainly because of the forced- commutated rectifier and because the generator is not required to produce a pull-out torque higher than the rated torque.},

abstract = {For permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs), accurate
magnet flux linkage information is critical for permanent magnet
condition monitoring and drive performance improvement. This paper
proposes a novel particle-filter-based magnet flux linkage estimation
approach by using the harmonics in the machine speed. In the proposed
approach, the harmonic current is first injected to change the speed
harmonics, and the particle filter is then applied to estimate the
magnet flux linkage from the speed harmonics. With a proper selection of
injected harmonic current, it is capable of simultaneously estimating
the magnet flux linkage and reducing the torque ripples as well as the
speed ripples. The proposed approach is based on the machine mechanical
equation, so it is not influenced by the magnetic saturation, the
resistance variation, and the inverter nonlinearity. Specifically, at
first, a novel state-space model is developed based on the machine
mechanical equation, which models the relation between the magnet flux
linkage and the speed harmonic. The state-space model is nonlinear, so
the particle filter is employed for a magnet flux linkage estimation.
Our particle-filter-based estimation approach is validated on a
laboratory PMSM drive system under different loads, speeds, and
temperatures.},

Temperatures and principal stresses for each of these cases were compared. Thermal diffusion and thermal stresses in armatures cannot be ignored past the first millisecond of launch; material properties under pulsed heating can significantly differ from equilibrium and room-temperature values. Armature wear and inertial loading can be ignored at low speeds, but not at high speeds ({\&}gt;1 km/s).

abstract = {The double pulse test (DPT) is a widely accepted method to evaluate the dynamic behavior of power devices. Considering the high switching-speed capability of wide band-gap devices, the test results are very sensitive to the alignment of voltage and current (V-I) measurements. Also, because of the shoot-Through current induced by Cdv/dt (i.e., cross-Talk), the switching losses of the nonoperating switch device in a phase-leg must be considered in addition to the operating device. This paper summarizes the key issues of the DPT, including components and layout design, measurement considerations, grounding effects, and data processing. Additionally, a practical method is proposed for phase-leg switching loss evaluation by calculating the difference between the input energy supplied by a dc capacitor and the output energy stored in a load inductor. Based on a phase-leg power module built with 1200-V/50-A SiC MOSFETs, the test results show that this method can accurately evaluate the switching loss of both the upper and lower switches by detecting only one switching current and voltage, and it is immune to V-I timing misalignment errors. {\textcopyright} 1986-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = { Most infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filter implementations in power electronic inverter applications are based on the time shift operator q and its associated z-transform. But for higher sampling frequencies where the sample period approaches zero for z-transform discrete systems, their dynamic response does not converge smoothly to the continuous counterpart, causing substantial implementation problems. In contrast, the response of filters based on the delta operator does converge to the continuous counterpart for smaller sample periods, and hence they are much better suited for digital control applications where sampling frequencies are much higher than the system poles. This paper describes the basis of the delta operator, its use for IIR digital filter systems, and shows how the technique can be used in power electronic inverter applications to achieve substantial performance benefits compared to equivalent shift-based implementations. A brief review of shift based IIR filtering is presented and the required conversions to the delta form given. The specific examples of an active filter and a P + Resonant current regulator are used to illustrate the improvements that can be expected. The superior performance of the delta operator for digital control of inverter applications has been verified in both simulation and experiment.},

Injecting active power and compensation of the reactive current of the system are realized simultaneously at daylight.

The switching process is illustrated in detail, including the interaction of the low voltage Si MOSFET and the high voltage GaN HEMT in cascode configuration. The switching loss is obtained by solving the equivalent circuits during the switching transition. The analytical results show that the turn-on loss dominates in hard-switching conditions while the turn-off loss is negligible, due to the intrinsic current source driving mechanism. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by numerous experimental results. The results of both the analytical model and experiments suggest that soft-switching is critical for high voltage GaN in high-frequency high-efficiency applications.},

abstract = { Since variable speed electric drive systems are supplied from power electronic converters, it is possible to utilize ac machines with a phase number higher than three. It is shown in the paper, using general theory of electrical machines, that an increase of the stator phase number to at least five (or more) enables completely independent vector control of two (or more) multiphase machines that are supplied from a single current-controlled voltage source inverter. In order to achieve such an independent control it is necessary to connect multiphase stator windings of the machines in series and perform an appropriate phase sequence transposition. The concept is equally applicable to any multiphase ac machine type and its major advantage, compared to an equivalent multimotor three-phase drive system, is the saving of a certain number of inverter legs. The actual saving depends on the number of phases. The concept is introduced using an n-phase induction machine as the starting point and further analysis is restricted to an odd number of phases, for the reason explained in the paper. Classification of all the possible cases that may arise is given, followed by presentation of connection diagrams for selected phase numbers. Detailed verification of the proposed concept is provided by simulating the operation of a seven-phase three-motor drive system, controlled using indirect rotor flux oriented control principles. Some preliminary experimental results, which confirm the feasibility of a two-motor series-connected drive system, are included as well. The main advantages and drawbacks of the concept, when compared with an equivalent three-phase multimotor drive system, are finally addressed.},

The main sources of these particles are Solar Energetic Particle Events - which usually occur in association with solar flares - and the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) - where the Earth's magnetosphere dips closest to the earth, causing more trapped radiation. Cumulative long term ionizing damage due to protons and electrons can cause devices can suffer threshold shifts, increased device leakage ({\&} power consumption), timing changes, decreased functionality, etc. Device shielding can help, but several factors must be considered. Shield geometry {\&} analysis technique, shield material composition, and device composition are all relevant in predicting shield effectiveness.

The primary goal is to reduce the switching frequency ripple at a reasonable cost, while at the same time achieving a high-performance front-end rectifier (as characterized by a rapid dynamic response and good stability margin). An example LCL filter design is reported and a filter has been built and tested using the values obtained from this design. The experimental results demonstrate the performance of the design procedure both for the LCL filter and for the rectifier controller. The system is stable and the grid current harmonic content is low both in the lowand high-frequency ranges. Moreover, the good agreement that was obtained between simulation and experimental results validates the proposed approach. Hence, the design procedure and the simulation model provide a powerful tool to design an LCL-filter-based active rectifier while avoiding trial-and-error procedures that can result in having to build several filter prototypes.},

abstract = {Although the concept of variable-speed drives, based on utilization of multiphase machines, dates back to the late 1960s, it was not until the mid- to late 1990s that multiphase drives became serious contenders for various applications. These include electric ship propulsion, locomotive traction, electric and hybrid electric vehicles, ldquomore-electricrdquo aircraft, and high-power industrial applications. As a consequence, there has been a substantial increase in the interest for such drive systems worldwide, resulting in a huge volume of work published during the last ten years. An attempt is made in this paper to provide a brief review of the current state of the art in the area. After addressing the reasons for potential use of multiphase rather than three-phase drives and the available approaches to multiphase machine designs, various control schemes are surveyed. This is followed by a discussion of the multiphase voltage source inverter control. Various possibilities for the use of additional degrees of freedom that exist in multiphase machines are further elaborated. Finally, multiphase machine applications in electric energy generation are addressed.},

abstract = {This study explores the integration issues of next-generation high-penetration photovoltaic (PV) systems, where the grid is becoming more decentralised and vulnerable. In that case, the PV systems are expected to be more controllable with higher efficiency and reliability. Provision of ancillary and intelligent services, such as fault ride-through and reactive power compensation, is the key to attain higher utilisation of solar PV energy. Such functionalities for the future PV inverters can contribute to reduced cost of energy, and thus enable more cost-effective PV installations. To implement the advanced features, a flexible power controller is developed in this study, which can be configured in the PV inverter and flexibly change from one to another mode during operation. Based on the single-phase PQ theory, the control strategy offers the possibilities to generate appropriate references for the inner current control loop. The references depend on system conditions and also specific demands from both system operators and prosumers. Besides, this power control strategy can be implemented in commercial PV inverters as a standardised function, and also the operation modes can be achieved online in predesigned PV inverters. Case studies have verified the effectiveness and flexibilities of the proposal to realise the advanced features.},

Results confirm that the inactive mass is greater than 60{\%} of the machine total mass, and at multimegawatt ratings it is almost 90{\%} of the total mass.

The transition speed of armature determines the performance of railgun, which makes increasing transition speed the main goal in armature geometry design. The trailing arm's length is considered as one of the most critical parameters in armature geometry. In this paper, experiments using monolithic C-armature of the same material (Al-6063), which had trailing arms of different lengths - 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 mm, were performed in a 20-mm caliber railgun. The maximum amplitude of driving currents under which these armatures launched without arcing was measured in launching experiments. Moreover, the length and positions of actual contact surfaces on armature trailing tails were compared by in-bore experiments. Results indicate that the increase of trailing arm length (from 15 to 25 mm) results in a significant increase of nonarc driving current; when the length exceeds 25 mm, this increase stops, which may be caused by the geometry deformation of armature in launch process. Two improved geometries of trailing arm, which were tested having good performance in rail launch experiments, are presented.},

Direct drive electrical generators offer a reliable alternative to conventional doubly fed induction generator machines since they omit the gearbox from the drive train. A fundamental issue for these generators is their large size which makes them difficult to manufacture, transfer and assemble. This study will investigate an analytical and a finite element analysis optimisation technique developed for minimising the structural mass of a direct drive generator. Both tools seek to minimise the mass of three different permanent magnet direct drive (PMDD) generators with 5 MW nominal power output while keeping a set of deflection criteria under limitations. The results indicate that the structural mass of a 5 MW PMDD generator can be effectively reduced with the help of these design tools. The research concludes in favour of a specific transversal flux PMDD topology, of which the electromagnetic topology benefits the structural design.},

abstract = {A concept is presented along with the overarching structure of the virtual power plant (VPP), the primary vehicle for delivering cost efficient integration of distributed energy resources (DER) into the existing power systems. The growing pressure, primarily driven by environmental concerns, for generating more electricity from renewables and improving energy efficiency have promoted the application of DER into electricity systems. So far, DER have been used to displace energy from conventional generating plants but not to displace their capacity as they are not visible to system operators. If this continues, this will lead to problematic over-capacity issues and under- utilisation of the assets, reduce overall system efficiency and eventually increase the electricity cost that needs to be paid by society. The concept of VPP was developed to enhance the visibility and control of DER to system operators and other market actors by providing an appropriate interface between these system components. The technical and commercial functionality facilitated through the VPP are described and concludes with case studies demonstrating the benefit of aggregation (VPP concept) and the use of the optimal power flow algorithm to characterise VPP.},

A 2D sub-domain field computational model with multi objective genetic algorithm (GA) is used for the design and performance prediction of the considered FT-PM machines. The machine electromagnetic losses including iron, magnet and winding losses are systematically computed using analytical tools. During the post processing stage a 1D analysis is employed for turn-turn fault analysis. The method calculates self and mutual inductances of both the faulty and healthy turns under a SC fault condition with respect to the fault locations, and thus SC fault current considering its location. Eight FT-PM machines with different S/P combinations are analysed. Both the performance of the machine during normal operation and induced currents during a turn-turn SC fault are investigated. To evaluate the thermal impact of each S/P combination under an inter-turn fault condition, a thermal analysis is undertaken using finite element (FE) computation. It is shown that low rotor pole number machines have better fault tolerance capability whilst high rotor pole number machines are lighter and provide higher efficiency. Results show that the influence of the S/P selection on inter-turn fault SC current needs to be considered during the design process to balance the efficiency and power density against fault tolerant criteria of the application at hand.},

abstract = {Increasing power system flexibility by responsive demand is a central issue for the incorporation of higher levels of variable wind generation in future power systems. The electrification of the heat sector, except from energy efficiency gains, may offer a vast potential of new forms of flexible demand, by time-shifting of heat production in buildings. The assessment of this potential can, however, be performed only when the limitations imposed by the primary operation of the equipment (space heating) are realistically taken into account. In this paper, a methodology is presented for the quantification of the flexibility offered by the thermal storage of building stock equipped with heat pumps, to power systems with significant penetration of wind power. A model is proposed for the incorporation of the building stock thermal behavior as equivalent energy storage in electricity market models. At the same time, the model allows the coupling to a detailed dynamic thermal model of buildings for the assessment of the respective operational restrictions. The case study presents the results of a project for the evaluation of the flexibility offered by portfolios of high heat pump deployment in conjunction with high wind penetration scenarios for the future German electricity system.},

abstract = {Silicon-based micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) can be fabricated using bulk and surface micromachining technology. A micro mirror designed as an oscillatory MEMS constitutes a prominent example. Typically, in order to minimize energy consumption, the micro mirror is designed to have high quality factors. In addition, a phase-locked loop guarantees resonant actuation despite the occurrence of frequency shifts. In these cases, the oscillation amplitude of the micro mirror is expected to scale linearly with the actuation input power. Here, however, we report on an experimental observation which clearly shows an amplitude depletion that is not in accordance with any linear behaviour. As a consequence, the actuation forces needed to reach the desired oscillation amplitude are by multiples higher than expected. We are able to explain the experimental observations accurately by introducing a single degree-of-freedom model including an amplitude-dependent nonlinear damping term. Remarkably, we find that the nonlinear damping shows a clear gas pressure dependency. We investigate the concepts and compare our findings on two different micro mirror design layouts.},

abstract = {This thesis presents an alternative approach to the analytical design of surface-mounted axialflux permanent-magnet machines. Emphasis has been placed on the design of axial-flux machines with a one-rotor-two-stators configuration. The design model developed in this study incorporates facilities to include both the electromagnetic design and thermal design of the machine as well as to take into consideration the complexity of the permanent-magnet shapes, which is a typical requirement for the design of high-performance permanent-magnet motors. A prototype machine with rated 5 kW output power at 300 min-1 rotation speed has been designed and constructed for the purposesof ascertaining the results obtained from the analytical design model. A comparative study of low-speed axial-flux and low-speed radial-flux permanent-magnet machines is presented. The comparative study concentrates on 55 kW machines with rotation speeds 150 min-1, 300 min-1 and 600 min-1 and is based on calculated designs. A novel comparison method is introduced. The method takes into account the mechanical constraints of the machine and enables comparison of the designed machines, with respect to the volume, efficiency and cost aspects of each machine. It is shown that an axial-flux permanent-magnet machine with one-rotor-two-stators configuration has generally a weaker efficiency than a radial-flux permanent-magnet machine if for all designs the same electric loading, air-gap flux density and current density have been applied. On the other hand, axial-flux machines are usually smaller in volume, especially when compared to radial-flux machines for which the length ratio (axial length of stator stack vs. air-gap diameter)is below 0.5. The comparison results show also that radial-flux machines with alow number of pole pairs, p {\textless} 4, outperform the corresponding axial-flux machines.},

For investigating the effects of magnetic flux on a GaN-HEMT, power device model for finite element method (FEM) simulation is proposed. In order to confirm the validity of the model, the quantitative evaluation is conducted with FEM simulation, and experiment using evaluation boards. Moreover, the optimization of printed circuit board layout is considered using the verified model with FEM simulation, for reducing the effects of magnetic flux onGaN-HEMTswhile reducing the area of converter. In the experiments, 5-MHz 48V/12V100Wunregulated LLC resonant dc-dc converter with efficient power conversion GaN-HEMTs is built as the prototype to verify the optimized layout. The maximum power efficiency can be achieved 91.28{\%}, and the power density can be achieved 32 W/cm(3).},

abstract = {In direct-drive electric propulsion systems, where there is no reduction gear to minimize and absorb the adverse effects of cogging torque generated by the permanent-magnet (PM) machine, minimization of cogging torque generation is of particular importance. In this paper, a novel axial pole-pairing method is proposed to minimize cogging torque generation in a special three-phase outer-rotor PM brushless machine, which uses uneven stator poles to enhance back electromotive force (EMF). Analytical formulas of the machine's cogging torque are first derived. The new technique is compared with conventional cogging torque suppression methods by means of analytical models and comprehensive finite-element analysis (FEA). The FEA results show that the new method not only achieves effective cogging torque reduction, but also results in improved harmonic content of the back EMF. The validity of the FEA model is verified by experimental results from the prototype machines. Finally, the significance of optimizing both the load-independent machine design techniques and load-dependent driving techniques to achieve overall torque ripple minimization is discussed.},

abstract = {The direct-drive radial flux synchronous generator is considered as the modern wind turbine drive train. Both the electri- cally (e.g., Enercon) and permanent magnet (PM; e.g., Siemens) excited direct-drive generators are gaining popularity on the market today. Compared with the matured geared counterpart, the electrically excited direct-drive generator is heavier and more expensive but more reliable per unit capacity. The PM-excited generator is expensive, is simpler in electrome- chanical design, has a high power-to-weight ratio, and yields a higher energy conversion efficiency than its electrically excited equivalent. The PM generator technology has the potential to yield the highest energy-to-cost ratio. However, standardization of this direct-drive generator parts/subassemblies may overcome the existing cost barrier.Most current lit- erature focuses on PM generator wind turbine technology, specifically on generator energy conversion optimization, and the scalability of technologies to capacities in access of 5MW. Strangely, PMgenerator's mass and cost reductions through optimized structural design incorporating manufacturing, transportation, and installation constraints are less studied. This paper solely focuses on themechanical and structural design aspects of large radial flux synchronousPMgenerators specific to direct-drive wind turbines. Generator topologies such as the common iron-cored and unconventional air-cored genera- tor are discussed. However, design considerations specific to the iron-cored generator topology are studied. The design considerations investigated involve the geometries and the configurations of rotor/stator active and inactive structures, the interfaces, and the conductor/PM mounting methods.

abstract = {The doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) now represents the dominant technology in wind turbine design. One consequence of this is limited damping and inertial response during transient grid disturbances. A dasiadecoupledpsila strategy is therefore proposed to operate the DFIG grid-side converter (GSC) as a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) during a fault, supporting the local voltage, while the DFIG operates as a fixed-speed induction generator (FSIG) providing an inertial response. The modeling aspects of the decoupled control strategy, the selection of protection control settings, the significance of the fault location and operation at sub- and super-synchronous speeds are analyzed in detail. In addition, a case study is developed to validate the proposed strategy under different wind penetrations levels. The simulations show that suitable configuration of the decoupled strategy can be deployed to improve system voltage stability and inertial response for a range of scenarios, especially at high wind penetration. The conclusions are placed in context of the practical limitations of the technology employed and the system conditions.},

abstract = {Current flow in the neighborhood of sharp conduct- ing edges and corners is encountered in many applications of computational electromagnetics. Some examples include resonant cavities and waveguides of rectangular shape, cracks in metal components in nondestructive testing, and the edges and corners of the rail–armature contact in an electromagnetic launcher. Al- though the number of analytical solutions to such problems is small, it is generally believed that such solutions often involve singularities, high gradients, or discontinuities in one ormore field components near the edge or corner. It has been demonstrated that the so-called edge elements can provide much more accurate predictions of global quantities (like resonant frequencies and scattering parameters) in the case of full-wave electromagnet- ics when field discontinuities or singularities are present. They have also been shown to better represent field discontinuities at material interfaces in magnetostatics and reentrant corners in low-frequency electromagnetics. This feature of edge elements is due to their ability to allow necessary jumps in field components at geometric or material discontinuities, as opposed to nodal ele- ments, with theCoulomb gauge enforced,which can overconstrain the fields in certain situations. The main question of interest in this paper is whether edge elements give a similar advantage in the representation of current diffusion around a sharp edge. Both edge- and node-based formulations are considered, and the results are discussed.},

The physical principle of VSE is Skin Effect of pulsed current in rails, and Clustering Near Small Source and Clustering Along Short Path of steady current in armature. The corresponding methods to restrain VSE was deduced and classified in this paper as the followings: 1) to lengthen the contact surface according to the velocity skin depth expression, 2) to add a hard and resistive cladding on the rail's sliding surface and 3) to narrow the interface considering the Clustering Near Small Source, 4) to adopt U-shaped armature instead of cuboid armature and 5) to control the armature legs' thickness distribution owing to Clustering Along Short Path. The equivalent 3-D models for VSE were adopted and the contrastive simulations were carried out for three kinds of armature's legs. The most uniformed distribution of current in three interfaces was accomplished, with which the typical uniform index is about 66{\%}. The conclusion reached was that the general use of five methods and reasonable design could effectively restrain velocity skin effect.},

@article{Ye2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1969-2012 IEEE. Available inertia and variable droop responses from a wind farm to support the short-term frequency control in power systems are analytically evaluated. The novelty lies in the approach to formulating the inertia constant and primary power reserve for a variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) that operates at derated conditions. The formulations are extended to evaluate the capability of providing inertia and primary frequency support from a wind farm using an aggregated wind speed. As a consequence, the capability as a function of VSWT operating characteristics and conditions is quantified to rationally adjust the frequency controller gains, thereby ensuring stable performance of the wind farms during frequency transients. A modified system frequency response (SFR) model considering available inertial and droop responses from wind farms is developed to well simulate the SFR following wind power fluctuations. The effectiveness of the analytical method is verified through comparisons of the results with those obtained from the empirical method.},

abstract = {When the wind power accounts for a large portion of the grid power, it may need to help the grid voltage and frequency regulation. This paper investigates a permanent-magnet wind generator with a full power voltage-source converter in weak-grid mode, where the DC-link voltage needs to be controlled from the generator side instead of the grid side. The energy relationship of the wind generator, DC-link energy storage, and load is established. An intrinsic right-half-plane zero, together with the wind power characteristics, the mechanical system inertia, and the DC-link energy storage, is identified as the physical limitations for the control. With the understanding of the system energy relationship and limitations, a hybrid adaptive control algorithm is proposed that searches for the optimal generator acceleration to achieve the maximum wind generator power change rate to match the load power variation. The proposed control scheme is verified through simulation of a 1.5-MW wind system as well as through the experiment of a scaled 1-kW, DSP-/field-programmable-gate-array-controlled, permanent-magnet-generator-based test bed. The results show that it is feasible to regulate DC link by the generator-side converter through the generator speed control. Some important applications issues are also investigated, including the DC-link energy storage requirement, wind speed change impact, and control transition between the weak-grid and strong-grid modes.},

Results of those tests showed good thermal and structural performance of the armature assembly and no melt transfer between the armature contact regions. Five tests were then conducted on the two-turn rail configuration. During the second test, the crossover that connects the two rail pairs at the breech suffered arcing damage at the rail contacts. A new crossover was fabricated, and all subsequent tests were successful with no crossover arcing.

Together with added frequency controlling functionality, this could facilitate inclusion of wind power in islanding systems, enabling greater system loads and enhancing power system stability. This paper describes modeling of power smoothing and frequency controlling wind plants and assesses different control strategies as well as the grid frequency performance gains achievable over hydro powered islanding systems and over islanding systems incorporating both hydro power and conventional wind plants.

The key phenomenon that causes these problems is the transition of the rectifier stage from three-phase to single-phase operation. Since the equivalent series resistance increases at low frequencies, the low-order harmonic current components (e.g., 120 and 240 Hz) contribute disproportionately to the capacitor power losses and temperature rise, resulting in reduced lifetime. Closed-form expressions are developed for predicting these effects including the impact of finite line impedance, finite bus capacitance, and varying load. The impact of inverter space-vector pulsewidth-modulation switching on the capacitor loss is also included. Simulations and experimental tests are used to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the closed-form analysis using a 5-hp ASD system},

abstract = {During the electromagnetic launch process, there is a contact surface
between the trailing arm of C-shaped armature and the rail. This contact
is generally provided by the deformation of the trailing arm, from which
it can keep a good metal-metal contact at the armature-rail interface,
while providing sufficient contact force to ensure the launch without
transition. Nowadays, C-shaped armatures with curved-surface trailing
arms are used in rectangular bore railguns. In this paper, the effect of
geometry change on the curve shape is investigated. Various kinds of
reasonable curve shapes are explored and simulated by using finite
element method. Contact pressure distributions and a series of contact
characteristics variables of C-shaped armature with different curve
shapes are calculated and compared respectively. Eventually, the
variation laws of contact characteristics at the armature-rail interface
with different kinds of curve shapes are acquired. 2-D and 3-D
simulations are both carried out, and the simulation results are quite
consistent with each other.},

High torque pulsation is the major disadvantage of most IPM motor configurations. A five-phase IPM motor with low torque pulsation is discussed. The mathematical model of the five-phase motor is given. A control strategy that provides fault tolerance to five-phase permanent-magnet motors is introduced. In this scheme, the five-phase system continues operating safely under loss of up to two phases without any additional hardware connections. This feature is very important in traction and propulsion applications where high reliability is of major importance.

abstract = {An improved gate driver is presented which significantly lowers the output noise of high-precision switch-mode (Class-D) power amplifiers by reducing signal jitter at the output of the power stage tenfold to values below 20 ps. Gate signal jitter in power electronic converters, which introduces wideband noise to the power output, originates mainly from the signal isolators that are required to provide the galvanically isolated gate driver control signals. A low-jitter gate control signal is produced by employing a digital flip-flop, which uses a low-jitter isolated clock, to re-synchronize the jittery gate control signal. By utilizing the clock-enable input of the flip-flop, the gate driver can be rendered immune to high-speed common-mode transients, which is important as the Class-D power amplifier demonstrator system employs fast-switching GaN E-HEMT transistors, where the 400V switching transients exceed 300 kV $\mu$s?1. The signal to noise ratio of a sinusoidal output signal is measured at 107 dB, which is an improvement of 20 dB as compared to the performance of a conventional gate driver.},

@article{Twining2003,
abstract = {Many grid connected power electronic systems, such as STATCOMs, UPFCs, and distributed generation system interfaces, use a voltage source inverter (VSI) connected to the supply network through a filter. This filter, typically a series inductance, acts to reduce the switching harmonics entering the distribution network. An alternative filter is a LCL network, which can achieve reduced levels of harmonic distortion at lower switching frequencies and with less inductance, and therefore has potential benefits for higher power applications. However, systems incorporating LCL filters require more complex control strategies and are not commonly presented in literature. This paper proposes a robust strategy for regulating the grid current entering a distribution network from a three-phase VSI system connected via a LCL filter. The strategy integrates an outer loop grid current regulator with inner capacitor current regulation to stabilize the system. A synchronous frame PI current regulation strategy is used for the outer grid current control loop. Linear analysis, simulation, and experimental results are used to verify the stability of the control algorithm across a range of operating conditions. Finally, expressions for ""harmonic impedance" of the system are derived to study the effects of supply voltage distortion on the harmonic performance of the system.},

The unit commitment problem with spinning reserve for MG is considered in this new method. The total cost function, which includes the cost of ESS, cost of output power and cost of spinning reserve, is introduced. The effectiveness of the approach is validated by a case study where the optimal ESS rating for MG is determined. The quantitative results show that the ESS with an optimal size is not only storing renewable energy and re-dispatching it appropriately, but also saving the the total cost for MG. The main method is formulated as a mixed nonlinear integer problem (MNIP), which is solved in AMPL (A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming).},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1965-2012 IEEE. This paper presents a novel scale-down hybrid-excited dual permanent magnet (PM) generator for direct-drive wind power application. Two sets of consequent-pole PMs are used in the proposed design, with one on the outer stator and the other on the middle rotor. PMs are separated by iron poles one by one, to form the magnet-iron sequences, which can provide PM excitation and flux modulating simultaneously. Since both the outer stator and middle rotor have flux modulating effect, bi-directional flux modulating can be achieved. Besides the fundamental field components, some other major field harmonics are also synchronous due to the bi-directional flux modulating effect, and these harmonics can contribute to the electromagnetic generation. Therefore, the proposed machine can achieve high torque density and suitable for direct-drive applications. Field windings are employed on the outer stator, so the air-gap field can be easily regulated by controlling the dc current. Hence, the proposed generator can maintain constant output voltage when the wind speed varies. Finite-element method coupled with genetic algorithm is used to optimize a scale-down design of the proposed generator, and its electromagnetic performances are studied in detail.},

In this class of problems, increased electromagnetic power density, fault tolerance, and high-temperature withstand properties are of major importance, and favored single-layer (SL) and double-layer (DL) fractional slot concentrated winding (FSCW) optimal topologies with different motor segmentation strategies have been compared. Under such strict nature of specifications, both operational and spatial, the implementation of advanced magnetic materials, particularly Vacoflux50 cobalt iron laminations and NMX-S43SH neodymium PMs, offer great services. The optimization methodology introduced is based on composite cost and penalty functions involving performance, efficiency, reliability, weight, and thermal criteria for multioperational behavior under normal and temporary overload conditions. An appropriate particle swarm optimization algorithm ensures fast convergence of the optimization variables. The resulting optimal SL and DL FSCW PMM configurations present certain complementary advantages, while the former one offering greater efficiency, thermal robustness, and physical segregation of the two motor parts is favored for this class of applications. Finally, the proposed motor configuration has been validated through measurements on a manufactured prototype.

abstract = {This paper presents a novel methodology for comparing thermal energy storage to electrochemical, chemical, and mechanical energy storage technologies. The underlying physics of this model is hinged on the development of a round trip efficiency formulation for these systems. The charging and discharging processes of compressed air energy storage, flywheel energy storage, fuel cells, and batteries are well understood and defined from a physics standpoint in the context of comparing these systems. However, the challenge lays in comparing the charging process of these systems with the charging process of thermal energy storage systems for concentrating solar power plants (CSP). The round trip efficiency and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) are the metrics used for comparison purposes. The thermal energy storage system is specifically compared to vanadium redox, sodium sulphur, and compressed air energy storage (CAES) systems from a large scale storage perspective of 100's of MWh. The rationale behind this analysis was to develop an electrical storage efficiency for molten salt thermal energy storage systems, such that it can be compared to battery energy storage technologies in the context of comparing CSP with thermal energy storage to solar photovoltaic with battery storage from a utility scale perspective. The results from the modelling using Andasol 3 CSP plant as a case study yield a storage efficiency of 86{\%} and LCOE of {\$}216/MWh. The results of this modelling will facilitate the future generation of a thermal energy storage roadmap.},

The characterization of VSEC extends our previous theoretical work in this area and provides new insights into the physics of EML operation, especially with regards to the armature and sliding contact. VSEC is a significant energy loss mechanism and heat source, possibly contributing to contact erosion and transition. We propose a similar VSEC mechanism to explain velocity saturation and efficiency roll-off in plasma and hybrid armature railguns, as well as arc restrike.},

abstract = {Pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) ac drives generate high differential-mode (DM) motor voltages due to the reflected wave phenomenon. The common-mode (CM) voltage produced by a PWM inverter also has fast transitions that result in high peak currents to ground. For low-power ac drives, this can present several issues, such as pump-up of the dc bus and failure of the power module due to high instantaneous currents that are often undetected because of the typical sampling algorithm used. In this paper, existing drive output filter solutions are reviewed, and a new filter design is presented, which has integrated DM and CM impedance with damping matched to typical cable surge impedance. This eliminates reflections of both DM and CM traveling waves and also reduces peak cable charging currents. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate that the new filter has improved performance to reduce motor DM and CM voltages and drive output CM current, thus mitigating the issues specifically seen with low-power ac drives. Complete design details for the filter and a particular implementation of the integrated DM and CM reactor are also presented.},

The rationale for the experiments was that armature materials with high melting points might outperform aluminum by reducing melting and erosion at the rail-armature interface. The tests used a novel technique that consists of placing thin claddings on the rail-contacting surfaces of the armatures. Two low-speed tests with copper armature claddings proved that claddings affixed to the trailing arms can survive a railgun launch. These tests were followed by four tests at about 2 km/s that used titanium armature claddings. These tests showed that titanium-clad armatures can perform well; however, this performance cannot be maintained beyond the first shot because the titanium armature claddings cause significant damage to the rails},

abstract = {—Future power systems will be characterized by the massive deployment of high power converters for so many applications (e.g. FACTS, HVDC, energy storage systems, etc.). These devices imposes new challenges on the operation and control of power systems, especially in terms of frequency support. Power converters tend to naturally decouple the new power production units from the AC power grid, disabling natural frequency response. It is expected this situation decreases the total system inertia affecting the ability of power system to overcome system frequency's disturbances. Wind power industry has developed several controllers to provide inertial response on wind turbines generators (WTG) enabling the frequency response: e.g. Artificial, Emulated, Simulated, or Synthetic Inertia. However, there is a clear lack of knowledge about activation scheme used for these controllers and how they work in practical manner. This paper proposes three activation schemes for synthetic inertia controller on WTG based on full rated power converters (FRC): (i) continuously acting (ii) under-frequency trigger and (iii) maximum-frequency gradient trigger. Simulations considering a test system are used for evaluation of the proposed activation schemes. The main contribution of this paper is the definition activations schemes for the synthetic inertia controller and the practical simulations results demonstrating the under-frequency trigger provides the best dynamic response in term of system frequency response.},

abstract = {The in-field validation of wind turbines behavior is very time consuming and cost intensive, especially when fault ride-through (FRT) tests are conducted. Full-size wind-turbine test benches allow a realistic operation of wind turbines in an artificial environment. Due to the independency of wind and grid conditions, the cost and duration of the test program and certification can be reduced. This paper presents the development of 4 MW full-size wind-turbine test bench following a multi-physics hardware in-the-loop (HiL) concept. With the currently installed test bench setup, a synchronization of the device-under-test converters is possible. Through the measurement results of the test programs conducted on the test bench, the capability of the test bench in replicating the field conditions is demonstrated. In addition, a time consuming efficiency measurement can be performed with the reduced duration on the test bench. This shows another main benefit of the test bench compared to the conventional test method for wind turbines. {\&}copy; 2015 IEEE.},

When the magnetization distribution of permanent magnet (PM) is given, the magnetic field in the air gap region is calculated by the quasi three dimensional (3D) space harmonic analysis (SHA) method. Once the flux density distribution in the winding region is determined, the required shape of the back EMF can be obtained by adjusting the winding distribution. This can be done by modifying the distance between patterns of PCB to control the harmonics in the winding distribution. The proposed method is verified by finite element analysis (FEA) results and it shows the usefulness of the method in eliminating a specific harmonic component in the back EMF waveform of a motor.},

The comparison is based on cost and annual energy yield for a given wind climate. The doubly-fed induction generator with single-stage gearbox seems the most attractive in terms of energy yield divided by cost. The doubly-fed induction generator with three-stage gearbox is a cheap solution using standard components.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1986-2012 IEEE.In this paper, we carried out an analysis of the breakdown characterization method by the investigation on off-state leakage currents and breakdown curves. For conventional breakdown, seven kinds of breakdown curves are summarized and it is found that only two of them can be shown by the conventional three-terminal breakdown characterization method reasonably. For the other five kinds of breakdown curves, the value of the gate leakage current is larger than that of the drain leakage current for a certain drain-bias range. Besides, the source leakage current cannot represent the buffer leakage current, and the values and signs of them are different. These problems contradict the conventional characterization method, indicating that the conventional method should be modified to characterize the breakdown mechanisms correctly. The similar problems also exist for time-dependent breakdown. The buffer and drain-gate leakage currents were obtained by a simple method and the conventional breakdown characterization method was modified by using these two currents. The problems in the conventional breakdown characterization method are solved by using the modified method. Experiments indicate that the modified breakdown characterization method is crucial to investigate the breakdown mechanisms, especially when source-gate leakage current cannot be neglected compared with the buffer leakage current.},

The transmission system converters provide variable speed generator control, and therefore individual converters are not required for each wind generator, implying savings in wind farm costs. The paper studies the technical and economical benefits of the proposed topology, as well as the selection of the main components. A detailed analysis of the control circuits for both generator and grid facing converters, with respect to primary control functions, is also given. PSCAD/EMTDC simulation of the proposed concept is presented for realistic wind signals. The results confirm operation at an average optimum coefficient of performance at each respective generator group, as well as satisfactory stability even for severe wind speed changes. The proposed concept reduces the costs associated with DC interconnection and may simplify integration of large offshore wind farms at substantial distances.},

However, the metal container would be necessary if the repulsion on the rails is great enough in mega Ampere current railgun. Then eddy current will be induced in metal container because of the variable magnetic flux density. In this paper, the effects eddy current putting on the inductance gradient of railgun are investigated with Maxwell 3D modular of Ansoft Corp.. Models of railgun with metal-insulated combination containment (laminated containment) are simulated and compared with solid metal containment railgun and air containment railgun. The eddy current density and Lorentz force put on amature of each model are calculated. It is found that the inductance gradient fluctuates with the armature position relative to containment and the fluctuating amplitude decreases with the electrical conductivity. The reduction of inductance gradient is very little when the metal segments of containment are not wider than caliber. It's notable that the inductance gradient decreases rapidly near muzzle.},

abstract = {Interest in permanent magnet synchronous machines for safety-critical applications has been increasing over the years. One of the most common methods for providing fault tolerance to a permanent magnet machine is the active control from the drive side. This method requires designing machines with the lowest possible mutual coupling between phases and a self-inductance that is high enough to limit the fault currents. Fractional-slot concentrated windings have been proposed as the most advantageous solution to meet these requirements. When comparing the numerous combinations of phases, poles and slots that give rise to a fractional-slot concentrated winding, the usual criteria only focus on obtaining a single-layer winding and do not actually consider the relationship between the self-inductance and the mutual inductance between phases. Moreover, they give no recommendations regarding the optimal number of phases from a magnetic point of view. The present work aims to cover this gap by obtaining analytical expressions for the calculation of the inductances in a permanent magnet machine. The derived expressions are investigated regardless of the geometry of the machine, and the criteria for selecting the most promising combinations in terms of the machine's fault tolerance are extracted.},

When the grid frequency is too high or too low, active power flow through the HVdc link will be ramped down or up. In turn, the wind generation will increase or decrease the blade angles to reduce or increase the captured wind power through pitch control. A case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the inertial enhancement and frequency droop in HVdc control. Simulation results in transient security assessment tool are given.},

abstract = {In several countries, the wind power penetration increased tremendously in recent years. To ensure the proper functioning of the power system, some grid operators already require the capability to provide inertial response or primary control with wind turbines. This paper discusses the emulated inertial response with wind turbines by means of the synthetic inertia and the droop control strategy. The behavior of the synthetic inertia strategy is determined by the inertial and the droop constant, whereas droop control only has a droop constant. When these strategies are used, it is important to tune the control parameters depending on the power system to which the wind turbines are connected. Simulations show that it is possible to enhance but also to deteriorate the frequency response of the system, dependent on these parameters. For different power system compositions, the optimal inertial constant is always close to zero. This way, the synthetic inertia strategy reduces to a fast droop control strategy. This is an important outcome, as it means that no differentiation of the frequency is needed to obtain an optimal inertial response from the wind turbines, which is beneficial in terms of robustness. Consequently, droop control is a viable alternative for the synthetic inertia.},

abstract = {As the penetration of variable renewable generation increases in power systems worldwide, planning for the effects of variability will become more important. Traditional capacity adequacy planning techniques have been supplemented with integration studies, which have been carried out in power systems with high targets for renewable generation. These have highlighted the increased variability that a system may experience in the future. As system generation planning techniques evolve with the challenge of integrating variable generation, the flexibility of a system to manage periods of high variability needs to be assessed. The insufficient ramping resource expectation (IRRE) metric is proposed to measure power system flexibility for use in long-term planning, and is derived from traditional generation adequacy metrics. Compared to existing generation adequacy metrics, flexibility assessment is more data intensive. A flexibility metric can identify the time intervals over which a system is most likely to face a shortage of flexible resources, and can measure the relative impact of changing operational policies and the addition of flexible resources. The flexibility of a test system with increasing penetrations of variable generation is assessed. The results highlight the time horizons of increased and decreased risk associated with the integration of VG.},

The voltage vector with the lowest torque and stator flux magnitude errors is selected to be applied in the next sampling interval. A high degree of flexibility is obtained with the proposed control technique due to the online optimization algorithm, where system nonlinearities and restrictions can be included.

abstract = {We present efficiency and scaling relationships for dc (i.e., noninduction) constant inductance gradient electromagnetic launchers.We derive expressions for electromagnetic force, efficiency, back-voltage, and kinetic power in terms of electrical circuit parameters. We show that launcher efficiency is a simple function of armature velocity and the launcher's characteristic velocity. The characteristic ve- locity characterizes the launcher and is the product of two new parameters: the mode constant and launcher constant. Mathematically, the launcher must operate at its characteristic velocity for 50{\%} maximum efficiency. The mode constant reflects the manner in which the launcher is powered and its maximum efficiency. The launcher constant reflects the geometry of the launcher.We consider two modes of operation: constant current and zero exit current operation.We develop the ideal electromagnetic launcher concept and define it as operation at 100{\%} maximum efficiency at all velocities.We also develop the concept of same-scale comparisons, that is, that electromag- netic launcher comparisons should be done with equal bore diameter, launcher length, projectile mass, and velocity. Finally, we present a comparative analysis based on experimental data of same-scale constant gradient electromagnetic launchers for conventional railgun, augmented railgun, and helical gun launchers in terms of the launcher constant, inductance gradient, bore diameter, bore length, system resistance, and armature (i.e., projectile) velocity.},

abstract = {Induction motors are commonly coupled to a gearbox when an application requires a low speed and a high torque. The gearbox is costly, needs maintenance and decreases the efficiency of the drive. Therefore, taking away the gearbox is very advantageous. This can be made possible by using a permanent magnet (PM) synchronous motor running directly at low speed, so called direct-drive PM synchronous motor. In this thesis, low-speed direct-drive PM motors are investigated for a 4.4 kW, 50 rpm mixer used for wastewater treatment. The thesis begins with an overview of different existing low-speed direct-driven applications. It concentrates then on a few topologies that are promising for the considered application: five different radial-flux PM machine configurations with surface-mounted or buried permanent magnets and two Torus axial-flux PM machine configurations. The designs of the PM machines are conducted by solving an optimization problem. The goal is to minimize the active weight of the machine, while fulfilling the requirements on the outer dimensions, the efficiency and the cost. The design process, based on analytical calculations as well as finite-element simulations, is described taking the particularities of each topology into account. Designs of low-speed radial-flux PM machines with high pole numbers are first calculated with conventional distributed windings and one slot per pole per phase. The results obtained for different PM machine configurations are compared. To improve further the designs, concentrated windings are investigated for PM machines with high pole numbers. Concentrated winding layouts offering high winding factors and limiting the rotor losses as well as the noise and vibrations of the machine are identified and sorted out. Some interesting concentrated winding layouts are combined with the different radial-flux PM machine configurations and further investigated with FEM simulations. The design of axial-flux PM motors is treated separately in the thesis. It was found that the Torus axial-flux PM machines are not satisfying the requirements of the application. Therefore multi-disk axial-flux PM machines are investigated. Finally, the investigated theoretical designs suitable for the application are compared and their advantages and drawbacks are emphasized.},

Test results from a 1-m-long, 1.27-cm square-bore, plasma-armature railgun have been used to determine the validity of the model. The divergence between the calculated and measured performance is typically less than 5{\%} at railgun currents below 500 kA; however, at currents greater than 500 kA, the deviation increases. Experimental evidence suggests that the railgun's lack of stiffness and subsequent venting of driving pressure rather than the electromechanical model is primarily responsible for the divergence. To test this theory, a rail was built using external preloading rings (Ringfeder) to increase its stiffness. On the first test of the Ringfeder railgun, 625 kA was discharged into the gun and the projectile was accelerated to 5.9 km/s. Test data indicate that the projectile accelerated through the entire length of the railgun and that a minimum amount of plasma leakage occurred during the test},

abstract = {The effects of eddy currents in transformer windings are considered, and a method is derived for calculating the variation of winding resistance and leakage inductance with frequency for transformers with single-layer, multilayer and sectionalised windings. The method consists in dividing the winding into portions, calculating the d.c. resistances and d.c. leakage inductances of each of these portions, and then multiplying the d.c. values by appropriate factors to obtain the corresponding a.c. values. These a.c. values are then referred to, say, the primary winding and summed to give the total winding resistance and leakage inductance of the transformer. Formulas are derived and quoted for calculating the d.c. resistances and leakage inductances of the winding portions. Theoretical expressions are derived for the variation with frequency etc. of the factors by which the d.c. values must be multiplied to obtain the corresponding a.c. values. These expressions are presented in the form of graphs, permitting the factors to be read as required.},

abstract = {The railgun launch of a solid armature is conventionally divided$\backslash$ninto two stages, namely, the initial stage, where a metallic contact is$\backslash$nretained between the armature and the rails, and the second, starting at$\backslash$na velocity {\~{}}0.3-2 km/s, where the contact occurs through the arc plasma.$\backslash$nWhile a variety of reasons for the transition were considered, no$\backslash$nuniversally accepted physical picture supported by experiment has thus$\backslash$nfar been formulated. We showed experimentally that under usual launch$\backslash$nparameters, 3D MHD instabilities form in the contact gap because of the$\backslash$nabsence of shear resistance, which result in the formation, collapse,$\backslash$nand, eventually, explosion of pinch waists (see E.M. Drobyshevski et al.$\backslash$nTech. Phys. Letts., vol.25 no.3, p.245-7, 1999). The destruction of the$\backslash$npinch waists gives rise not only to termination of current flow from the$\backslash$narmature to the rail through the metal and transformation of the$\backslash$nmetallic contact in the armature/rail interface into an arc gap, but to$\backslash$nejection of the liquid metal and dusty plasma from the gap forward and$\backslash$nback into the railgun bore as well. Even in the absence of MHD$\backslash$ninstabilities, armature material can be shed due to very inhomogeneous$\backslash$ndistribution of fields of thermal, electric, and dynamic parameters in$\backslash$nthe armature body. Appearance of easily-ionized matter in the bore$\backslash$nresults in the formation of shunting arcs there, which naturally reduce$\backslash$nthe armature launching efficiency. The new physics revealed by the$\backslash$nauthors in the railgun solid-armature launch transition to the arc$\backslash$nregime provides a basis for a search for ways of increasing the launch$\backslash$nefficiency},

As a result of indoor testing, a reduction rate of 1/5 for harmonic currents and 1/7 for reactive power were achieved.

abstract = {This thesis focuses on permanent magnet "direct drive" electrical generators for wind turbines with large power output. A variety of such generator topologies is reviewed, tested and optimised in an attempt to increase their potential as commercial concepts for the wind industry. Direct drive electrical generators offer a reliable alternative to gearbox drivetrains. This novel technology reduces energy loses thus allowing more energy to be yield from the wind and decreases the maintenance cost at the same time. A fundamental issue for these generators is their large size which makes them difficult to manufacture, transport and assembly. A number of structural designs have been suggested in the literature in an attempt to minimise this attribute. A set of design tools are set out in an attempt to investigate the structural stiffness of the different permanent magnet direct drive generator topologies against a number of structural stresses that apply to such wind turbine energy converters. Optimisation techniques, both analytical and structural, are also developed for minimising the total mass of a variety of "directly driven" machines with power output of 5MW or greater. Conventional and promising generator designs are modelled and optimised with the use of these optimisation techniques. The topologies under examination are then compared in terms of structural mass, stiffness and cost. As the number of wind turbine manufactures who adopt the direct drive concept increases, it is important to outline the unique characteristics of the different topologies and increase their manufacturing potential. Discussions and conclusions will provide an indication of the design solutions that could help decrease the mass and cost of such machines.},

abstract = {The C-GEN is a novel topology of direct drive air-core permanent magnet generator being developed at University of Edinburgh [1]. The topology has many benefits such as; absence of cogging torque, reduced mass and ease of manufacturing. A 20 kW prototype test rig and 15kW machine for a wind turbine has been manufactured and tested previously. Initial sizing studies for wind turbines indicate that the C-GEN concept will be up to 50{\%} lighter than conventional iron cored PM direct drive generators [1]. In addition to the applications wind turbines, C-GEN technology can also be implemented for marine energy power take-off systems. To investigate that, a feasibility study is being undertaken in collaboration with two wave and two tidal energy companies. In this paper, design and optimization method of an axial flux permanent magnet generator for a tidal energy converter device has been investigated. An analytical optimization tool is designed that combines electromagnetic, structural and thermal aspects of the machine design. A genetic algorithm optimization method has been utilized based on the operation conditions of generator and pre-defined constraints on dimensions and material limitations. The output of the analytical design tool is compared with the electromagnetic FEA simulations. The results showed that proposed analytical calculation method is consistent with FEA results},

abstract = {We enrolled 55 subjects in this investigation, 35 women and 20 men. All subjects were healthy nonsnorers without evidence of sleep-disordered breathing during polysomnography. Subjects were divided into 3 groups: men (n=20), premenopausal women (n=25), and postmenopausal women (n=10). Details on the de-mographics of the subjects can be found in the Results section. Menopause status was determined in all the women by measur-ing serum levels of estrogen, estradiol, and follicular stimulating hormone (FSH). Women were considered menopausal if the FSH was greater than 40 mIU/mL. Premenopausal women were stud-ied during the follicular stage of the menstrual cycle. The analysis included the following information: age, body mass index (BMI), baseline upper airway resistance measured during NREM sleep, awake and baseline NREM sleep PETCO 2 levels, and measures of the apnea threshold (see Data Analysis below). Results from studies performed on some of the men (n=13) and premenopausal women (n=16) included in this dataset have been previously pub-lished. 13-15 Protocol {\#}2: Effect of Hormone Replacement on the Apnea Threshold in Postmenopausal Women We investigated the effect of hormone replacement on the ap-nea threshold in 6 postmenopausal women confirmed by measure-ment of FSH (FSH {\textgreater} 40 mIU/mL). A baseline study to determine the apnea threshold was conducted on each subject without any medication. After the baseline study, subjects underwent HRT for 1 month with oral medroxyprogesterone acetate, 5 mg per day, and estrogen (conjugated equine estrogen), 1.25 mg per day. A second study to determine the apnea threshold was performed 30 days after hormone replacement. Total estrogen, estradiol, and FSH levels were measured at baseline and 30 days after receiving HRT. We did not measure progesterone levels because medroxy-progesterone acetate is a synthetic progestin and does not cross-react in a progesterone assay. The studies will be noted as baseline for the pre-HRT study and on-HRT for the 1-month study.},

32-MJ muzzle energy. A series of modular pulsed alternator power system
(MPAPS) with the different number of modules is designed and analyzed
based on the scaling laws. The system performances are simulated using
MATLAB. Taking into account all system performances, especially the
output current pulse-shape flexibility, the MPAPS composed of six
alternators is selected. The six modules are divided into three pairs of
matched contra-rotating pulsed alternators; each pair has the
independent firing time. By optimizing the voltage and the firing time
of each pair, a relatively flat-topped current pulse is produced. The
average-to-peak acceleration ratio of railgun reaches 0.67. Therefore,
this design of MPAPS is an option for a long-range railgun.},

development of control strategies in a safe and inexpensive environment

This paper describes the implementation of a high-fidelity real-time
emulator of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) drive in a

the drive operation under both healthy conditions and during inter-turn
stator winding faults. Nonlinearities due to saturation, higher order
harmonics, slotting effects, etc. are accounted for using
four-dimensional look-up tables obtained by finite element analysis
(FEA). The proposed model is computationally efficient and capable of
running in real-time in a FPGA platform and is validated against
simulations and experimental results in a wide range of operating
conditions. Potential applications of the proposed emulation environment
to the development of drive control, fault detection and diagnostic

@article{Merrill2003,
abstract = { An analytic model of the current melt wave in a one-dimensional stationary conductor has been developed to gain insight into the complex problem of melt-wave erosion contact wear in railgun armatures. Unlike two-dimensional models with motion, in which the dominant driving mechanism for the erosion front is current concentration from the velocity skin effect, in one dimension, the driving mechanism is a concentration of current caused by the electrodynamics at the melt-wave erosion boundary. Specifically, as molten material is ejected, current is driven into the remaining solid material at the interface, resulting in a local concentration of current and joule heating at the interface. We derive an expression for the velocity of the melt-wave front in one dimension, and assess the importance of this effect by comparing the erosion speed we obtain with erosion speeds predicted by previous models. The comparison suggests that the electrodynamics of the moving melt-wave boundary has an insignificant effect on melt-wave erosion in solid armature railguns, and as such can be justifiably neglected.},

abstract = {The chapter deals with the description of Fussy Logic (FL) principles and its application in power electronics and motor-drive systems. The FL is a discipline under Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is basically computer emulation of human thinking (called computational intelligence). The goal of AI is to mimic human intelligence. AI also includes expert systems (ESs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), or neural networks (NNWs), and genetic algorithms (GAs). All of the main areas in AI, except ES, are defined as soft computing. The concept of FL and its characteristics emerge from Zadeh's theory propounded in 1965. Any FL application uses a knowledge base that consists of multivalued membership functions (MFs) describing the fuzzy variables and the rule table consisting of “IF{\ldots} THEN{\ldots} statements.” The knowledge base is developed on the basis of the behavioral nature of the system. The trial-and-error approach of FL algorithms may be time consuming, but user-friendly computer programs (such as the MATLAB-based Fuzzy Logic Toolbox) help speed the process. The applications of FL principles, include speed control of induction motor vector drives, efficiency optimization of induction motor vector drives by flux programming; and wind generation systems, linearization of the transfer characteristics of thyristor converters at discontinuous conduction, induction motor stator resistance estimations, estimation of distorted waveforms and MRAC slip gain tuning control of vector drives.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to minimize the structural mass of large direct-drive wind generators using a ring-shaped buoyant rotor structure. A surface mounted permanent-magnet machine configuration is chosen for the proposed generator. The active mass of the generator is estimated by an electromagnetic design. Structural deformation equations for the proposed generator are derived, and the structural dimensions of the generator are initially determined from the equations. Using a three-dimensional finite element analysis, the structural dimensions are modified and the structural mass is estimated. The total mass of the proposed generator estimated by the design and the analysis is 89, 195 and 430 tonnes for 5, 10 and 20 MW wind turbines. The results indicate that the proposed generator is lighter than conventional direct-drive generators, and becomes lighter than the geared generator in scaling up larger than 9 MW.},

abstract = {The resonant current control has been extensively employed to reduce the current harmonic distortion in a wide range of grid-connected distributed generation applications, including photovoltaic (PV) inverters, wind and water turbines, and fuel-cell inverters. However, the performance of these systems is deteriorated when the utility grid voltage experiences abnormal conditions such as voltage harmonics and imbalances. Several advanced control solutions have been recently introduced to cope with this problem but at the cost of a significant increase in the control computational load. This paper first analyzes the limitations of the standard resonant current control operating under abnormal grid conditions and then introduces a control scheme that improves the current harmonic distortion in such adverse conditions without increasing the computational load of the standard current control. This theoretical contribution is validated by means of selected experimental results from a three-phase PV inverter.},

@article{Widyan2006,
abstract = {This thesis presents design, optimization, construction and test of radial-flux low-speed rare-earth high-energy permanent-magnet (PM) electrical machines with new topology. Two of the designed machines can be used as directly driven wind energy generators. Due to absence of the field current and field winding, permanent magnet generators exhibit high efficiency in operation, simple and robust structure in construction and high power to weight ratio. The attractiveness of the permanent magnet generators is further enhanced by the availability of high-energy permanent magnet materials like NdFeB. Based on the equivalent magnetic circuit approach and permanent magnet load line characteristics, iterative preliminary design for the proposed generator was firstly carried out. The aim of this simple linear pre-design tool was to have an initial geometry for the detailed investigations of the finite element technique (FET) where the electromagnetic behavior of the machine was optimized. The stator of the machine was slotted. Slotted configuration was chosen as it permits lower effective air gap length and therefore thin magnets can be used. This, in fact, largely decreases the cost of active material as it is dominated by that of the magnets. However, cogging torque comes as a consequence of slots. The cogging torque of the machine was estimated using the flux-MMF technique enhanced by the FET. Cogging torque is an oscillatory torque caused by the variation of the co-energy of the permanent magnets with respect to the rotor position, resulting from the variation of the magnetic circuit seen by the magnets. It is an inherent characteristic of slotted permanent magnet machines. It should be studied and minimized in the applications where minimizing torque ripple, vibration and noise are essential requirements. The configuration of the rotor corresponding to the lowest cogging torque was adopted. The prototype machine was constructed using novel updated high-energy permanent magnets with a remanent of 1.41T. The stator laminations of the machine were cut using laser technology methods. The slots of the machine were flat and the windings were of toroidal type (torus) with short ends. This, in turn, reduced the cost and weight of active material and improved the efficiency. The permanent magnets were rectangular blocks of NdFeB with flux concentration arrangement and magnetized tangentially on the rotor support structure. Soft magnetic material is attached to both poles of the permanent magnets, which not only produced an easy path for the flux penetration but also reduced the leakage flux and therefore a typical ‘rule of thumb' value for the leakage flux coefficient was achieved. The rotor support structure of the machine was manufactured from nonmagnetic light material (Aluminum). To further reduce the total weight of the machine, longitudinal holes were excavated inside the rotor support structure. The constructed prototype machine was tested as variable low-speed generator with different loading conditions. Good agreement between the theoretically predicted and experimentally obtained results has been achieved. The inertia of the system together with the cogging torque necessitated a peak starting torque of 64{\%} of the rated torque. To reduce this starting torque, the slot openings were filled up with bonded soft magnetic material with a relative permeability equals 10. The peak value of the starting torque has been reduced to 43{\%} of the rated torque. The cogging torque of the machine was estimated again and the performance of the slot-filled machine was studied and compared with the previous case. The manufactured prototype machine was single phase. Three-phase is also possible. The number of phases is usually determined based on the type of the load and the rated power demand. Finite element analysis and theoretical study were carried out on two three-phase machines of the same topology. The first one is a four-pole three-slot machine and the second one is ten-pole six-slot design.},

The heat exchange between the heat transfer fluid and the PCM and its phase change are investigated. Under simplifying assumptions, it is shown that the governing equations are the three energy conservation equations written for the heat transfer fluid, the wall and the PCM. The PCM energy conservation equation is written in terms of enthalpy. All three parabolic differential equations are numerically solved according to a finite difference approach implemented in MATLAB language. The simulations are conducted in order to derive the temperature profiles inside the PCM and to estimate the time needed to complete the melting of the PCM. Different simulation campaigns are conducted varying the inlet temperature of the heat transfer fluid. The obtained results can be used as guidelines for more careful studies of the thermal storage system and for subsequent analysis and optimization processes.},

The main advantage of this configuration is a smooth torque, which is due to the elimination of periodicity between slots and poles. A second advantage is a higher fault-tolerant capability, making the machine able to work even in faulty conditions. However, the fractional-slot configuration presents a high content of MMF harmonics that may cause an unbalanced saturation and thus an unbearable torque ripple. A method to design fractional-slot machines is illustrated in this paper, including double-layer and single-layer windings. The analytical computation is extended to determine the harmonics of MMF distribution. Their effect is highlighted in isotropic as well as anisotropic machines. Finally, some considerations are reported to avoid unsuitable configurations},

An important issue associated with accurate grid voltage monitoring is the presence of an offset in the measured grid voltage. This voltage offset is typically introduced by the measurements and data conversion processes and causes errors for the estimated parameters of the grid voltage. Accordingly, this paper presents an offset rejection method for grid-connected converters based on a Phase-Locked-Loop (PLL) technique. The offset rejection method relies on the Second Order Generalized Integrator (SOGI) having the advantages of a simple implementation independent of the grid frequency and avoidance of filtering delays due to its resonance at the fundamental frequency. Selected experimental results validate the performance and robustness of the proposed offset rejection method},

abstract = {In recent years, model predictive control (MPC) has been successfully used for the control of power electronics converters with different topologies and for different applications. MPC offers many advantages over more traditional control techniques such as the ability to avoid cascaded control loops, easy inclusion of constraint, and fast transient response. On the other hand, the controller computational burden increases exponentially with the system complexity and may result in an unfeasible realization on modern digital control boards. This paper proposes a novel distributed MPC (DMPC), which is able to achieve the same performance of the classical MPC while reducing the computational requirements of its implementation. The proposed control approach is tested on a ac/ac converter in a back-to-back configuration used for power flow management. Simulation results are provided and validated through experimental testing in several operating conditions.},

@article{Pena-Alzola2014,
abstract = {Grid-connected converters employ LCL-filters, instead of simple inductors, because they allow lower inductances while reducing cost and size. Active damping, without dissipative elements, is preferred to passive damping for solving the asso- ciated stability problems. However, large variations in the grid inductance may compromise system stability, and this problem is more severe for parallel converters. This situation, typical of rural areas with solar and wind resources, calls for robust LCL-filter design. This paper proposes a design procedure with remarkable results under severe grid inductance variation. The procedure considers active damping using lead-lag network and capacitor current feedback. Passive damping is also discussed. The design flow, with little iteration and no complex algorithms, selects the proper ratios between the switching and resonance frequency, the grid and converter inductance, and the filter capacitance and total inductance. An estimation for the grid current total harmonic distortion (THD) is also proposed. Simulation and experiments validate the proposals},

abstract = {Interturn short-circuit faults that occur inside stator coils are difficult to cope with compared with terminal short-circuit faults. A general analytical model for interturn short-circuit faults is developed that employs a novel T-type equivalent circuit. When this model is used to investigate the impact of interturn short-circuit faults in permanent-magnet (PM) machines with fractional slot concentrated windings (FSCW), the model delivers fault response predictions that agree very well with results from the finite element analysis. The model is used to show that the 24-slot/14-pole FSCW PM machine is vulnerable to very high interturn fault currents, even when the remaining turns are shorted, offsetting its advantage of low magnetic coupling between phases. FSCW-PM machines that employ aligned coils in phase windings can effectively suppress their interturn fault currents. Experimental verifications are provided for the 24-slot/22-pole FSCW PM prototype machine (with two aligned coils per phase) under the single-turn short-circuit fault. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

method, the self-inductance gradient (L-r') was got. The control
equations of these different resistance models can be solved by the

The first uses a one-dimensional finite-difference formulation and provides a starting point for understanding the effects of applied field and material properties on erosion speed. The second approach involves manipulating material properties in the three-dimensional (3-D) finite-element analysis (FEA) code EMAP3D. Because EMAP3D cannot eject material from the computation in the same manner as the finite-difference code, a "pseudoerosion" algorithm was devised to render cells above the melting temperature nonconducting. A comparison of the two approaches shows results that are in good agreement for depth of magnetic diffusion, current density, and temperature rise, as well as for depth and speed of erosion. These results are encouraging because they suggest that EMAP3D could be used to model melt-wave erosion in realistic 3-D armatures.},

abstract = {Current ramp-up is an important stage for railgun electromagnetic launch
system. In lots of launching experiments, a big chunk of deposit
aluminum can be found on the rail surface at the start-up position of
the armature-rail contact area, sometimes, erosion can even be turned
up. The transition at current ramp-up is mainly related to local
degradation of armature. The bigger value of maximum current densities
at the rail/armature (A/R) interface lead armature local temperature to
increase rapidly, which can deteriorate the material property of
armature, degrade the static electrical contact performance, and
significantly reduce the railgun lifetime.
In this paper, for restraining startup transition, several influencing
factors of armature degradation and melt are studied basis of current
concentration. Rail resistivity, rail dimensions, armature resistivity
and the shape of current supply are considered and simulated. At current
start up, skin effect and induced current are analyzed, and which are
considered as the direct factors of armature's current distribution.
Armature current distribution and the maximum current density are
obtained and compared for each factor. At last, launching experiments
are carried out as the same condition with simulation, the deposition on
the rail surface at the startup position of the A/R interface reflect
that the different factors influence the current distribution on
armature at the current ramp up, and the results are in reasonable
agreement with simulation description.},

abstract = {A four-stage XRAM generator is built and then applied to a railgun
having a caliber of 15 x 15 mm. The XRAM generator is based on 1-mH
Brooks coils and on standard high-power thyristors which are employed as
opening switches according to the ICCOS countercurrent commutation
principle. The coils of the generator are charged with a current of 10
kA, which corresponds to an energy of 200 kJ. The current is
successfully commutated and a pulse with a maximum current of 40 kA is
applied to the railgun. Consequently, a projectile with a total weight
of 33 g is accelerated to 157 m/s within the railgun length of 2.1 m.
The semiconductor switches are exposed to a steep voltage rise due to
the muzzle flash when the projectile leaves the railgun without their
critical limit being exceeded. Thus, the successful operation of the
XRAM generator using semiconductor switches during railgun experiments
is demonstrated. Furthermore, we are able to show in a further
experiment that the muzzle flash of the railgun can be significantly
reduced by switching the XRAM back into charging mode when the
projectile leaves the bore. This method also allows the conservation of
the energy that remains in the coils after the exit of the projectile
from the railgun.},

abstract = {The flux-switching permanent-magnet (FSPM) motor has been viewed as a highly reliable machine with both armature windings and magnets on the stator. Owing to the high torque-production capability with low torque ripple, FSPM motors with a higher number of phases are potential candidates for traction applications in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). However, existing research has mostly focused on the principles and static performance of multiphase FSPM motors, and little attention has been paid to advanced control strategies. In this paper, the fully decoupled current control of a 36/34-pole nine-phase FSPM (NP-FSPM) motor is developed and the performance under different operating conditions is investigated. The aim of the design is to alleviate cross coupling effects and unwanted low-order stator harmonic currents, to guarantee fast transient response and small steady-state error. In addition, its fault-tolerance is further elaborated. These features are very important in automotive applications where low torque pulsation, high fault-tolerant capability and high dynamic performance are of major importance. Firstly, the research status of multiphase FSPM motors is briefly reviewed. Secondly, the mathematical model in the dq reference frames and control strategies are presented. Then, the control and performance of the NP-FSPM motor are evaluated by using MATLAB/Simulink. Finally, experiments on an NP-FSPM motor prototype are carried out to validate the study.},

In this paper, the contact interference between the rail and armature in a railgun is calculated using a finite-element structural analysis code. The contact properties, including the contact pressure and contact area, are analyzed. It is found that a contact separation caused by the interference is inevitable in armatures with line-shaped contact interference. The reduction of the contact interference in an armature design cannot eliminate this kind of contact separation. A proper design of the armature structure can decrease the length of the separation effectively. A new design of the contact interference is proposed. Both the experiments and calculations show that the new design of the contact interference can effectively improve the performance of the armature.},

abstract = {Battelle's Columbus Division recently completed a Small Caliber Electromagnetic Launcher (EML) Engineering Feasibility Study Program under funding from the U.S. Army Armament Research and Development Center Joint Services Small Arms Program. Included in the study program was a preliminary feasibility and conceptual design study of a novel, hybrid EML with a pulsed, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator power supply. This concept was evolved by Battelle under an earlier Joint Services Small Arms Program Office effort. The system to be designed was a 0.30 caliber, tactical, portable EML capable of accelerating a 2.5 g projectile to near 1500 m/s, using a 1 m railgun and a solid armature. A first-order performance model for the integrated EML and generator was developed and implemented on a personal computer. Trade studies were conducted on numerous parameters of interest, and required propellant and other characteristics were specified. Results of the model development and trade studies are presented herein, and they indicate that significant technology advances are required to weaponize this EML concept. For the purposes of conducting the necessary para- metric studies, a baseline launcher configuration was specified. A 1 m long generator and a 1 m long railgun were selected, with an average generator channel diameter of 25.4 mm, and a railgun bore diameter of 7.62 mm. Rails and electrodes were taken to be copper for all cases. The downstream 50{\%} of the MHD channel was made active, with the magnetic field provided by external, battery-powered saddle coils. The projectile was initially accelerated by a pressure sufficient that 200 m/s velocity was reached by the time the current is first applied, The baseline generator characteristics were taken as: a 5 T magnetic flux density, a 2000 m/s plasma velocity, and an effective plasma conductivity of 2000 mho/m. With such a generator, a projectile muzzle velocity of 1520 m/s is predicted.},

abstract = {A superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) is an attractive power supply for electromagnetic rail launchers (EMRL), which require pulse currents to launch projectiles at very high speeds. Moreover, the accelerating force in an EMRL may be enhanced by adding a background field, a principle known as launcher S3EL concept (Superconducting Self-Supplied Electromagnetic Launcher) consists in using the SMES both as a power supply and for background field generation. The challenge is to reach the operating current and peak magnetic field of such launchers, which can be up to hundreds of kA and up to 10 T. The use of a high-temperature superconductor is mandatory to maintain superconducting operation during a launch, though operation at 4.2 K is foreseen to benefit from the RareEarth-BaCuO (REBCO) tape high critical current densities. The aim of this work is to derive a practical design for a 1-m-long small-scale S3EL proof of concept using REBCO coated conductor, with a reduced output velocity (100 m/s). After preliminary sizing studies, the spatial constraints for the SMES-Launcher integration is presented. A parametric joint analytical and Finite Element Method (FEM) study is conducted to refine the design and maximize the operation margins while maintaining the launch performances. Finally, cable design and discharge method suitable to reach the required operating current are presented. {\textcopyright} 2002-2011 IEEE.},

The IMMD concept strives to meet aggressive power density and performance targets by modularizing both the machine and power electronics and then integrating them into a single combined machine-plus-drive structure. Physical integration of the power electronics inside the machine makes it highly desirable to increase the power electronics operating temperature including higher power semiconductor junction temperatures and improved device packaging.$\backslash$nRecent progress towards implementing the IMMD concept in an integrated traction motor drive is summarized in this paper. Several candidate permanent magnet (PM) machine configurations with different numbers of phases between 3 and 6 are analyzed to compare their performance characteristics and key application features. A 6-phase, 10-pole PM machine topology has been selected as the most promising configuration for meeting the major requirements in the areas of power density, efficiency, and module count. A parallel investigation of fault-tolerant distributed control configurations for the IMMD traction drive has led to selection of a heterarchical controller configuration that requires each phase module to be equipped with its own independent microcontroller operating as a peer with all of the other phase module controllers.$\backslash$nThe potential of silicon (Si) insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) operating at junction temperatures up to 200°C has been evaluated using a hardware testbed in terms of device losses and thermal issues.

Thermal performance characterization has been conducted for different packaging structures, operating conditions and coolant selections. The proposed packaging design and cooling approach can maintain the Si IGBT junction temperature below 200°C with an ambient temperature of 150°C.},

We apply 2-D finite-element method (FEM) simulations to evaluate the accuracy of each method for predicting proximity-effect losses. We find that both methods can have substantial errors, exceeding 60{\%}. The Ferreira method, which is based on the exact Bessel-function solution for the eddy current in an isolated conducting cylinder subjected to a time-varying magnetic field, is found to be most accurate for loosely packed windings, whereas the Dowell method, which approximates winding layers comprising multiple turns of round wire with a rectangular conducting sheet, is most accurate for closely-packed windings. To achieve higher accuracy than is possible with either method alone, we introduce a new formula, based on modifying the Dowell method. Parameters in the new formula are chosen based on fitting our FEM simulation data. By expressing the results in terms of normalized parameters, we construct a model that can be used to determine proximity-effect loss for any round-wire winding with error under 2{\%}.},

abstract = {Thermal management plays a pivotal role in achieving high power densities in converters. Improvement on thermal performance of critical components in printed-circuit board (PCB) assembled switch mode converters is achieved by using design techniques that extend across electromagnetic, geometrical, and thermal-integration technologies. For better use of the already available PCB material, three-dimensional component layout and flexible PCB technology are utilized to gain advantages. A theory to evaluate the thermal-management effectiveness of switch mode converters is introduced based on two new figures of merit, namely thermal-management loss density and thermal-design rating. These two figures of merit quantify the effective use of thermal-management material as well as the thermal performance of a converter design. The figure-of-merit criteria allow flexibility so that it can be adjusted to an appropriate design objective. Design objectives include achieving higher power densities or achieving good reliability. The thermal-management-effectiveness theory is applied here to thermally optimize a Flyback converter that has been geometrically integrated. The design technique to adjust the thermal-management effectiveness of integrated switch mode converters to achieve a set objective, by means of the introduced figures of merit, forms the core of the publication, validated by experimental measurements},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for open-phase fault detection of a five-phase permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motor (PMa-SynRM). Under faults, the five-phase PMa-SynRM is expected to run at fault-tolerant control (FTC) mode, otherwise it draws a large amount of current with a significant reduction in the reluctance torque. To successfully achieve FTC operation of five-phase PMa-SynRM, the accurate detection of a fault condition has to be preceded. With the best of these authors knowledge, the detection of faults has been limitedly studied for five-phase motors. The analysis of open-phase fault in five-phase machine involves complicated conditions including single-phase open fault, two-phase adjacent fault, and two-phase nonadjacent fault. To perform the timely fault-tolerant operation, those faults have to be accurately analyzed and detected. In this paper, a novel symmetrical components (SCs) analysis is utilized to extract the feature of those fault conditions. This analysis will provide the types of faults by logically analyzing the pattern of magnitude and phase angle changes of the fundamental signal in the SCs. The proposed method has been comprehensively analyzed through theoretical derivation, finite-element simulations, and experimental testing through a 5 hp PMa-SynRM controlled by TI-DSP F28335.},

abstract = {Based on the state-of-the-art in the relevant fields, the main objectives of the project are: a) To achieve self-organized TiO 2 nanotubes (NTs) with a similar degree of order as with porous Al 2 O 3 and Si. This part of the work is mainly carried out at the coordinators' laboratory and is performed constantly over the duration of the project. It has been possible to generate porosity in many different valve metals so far [1-7] which is a very promising precondition for this part of the project. The very interesting results in this area have shown that there is a broad range of systems that can be treated to generate porous structures and that, depending on the conditions of anodizing, various pore dimensions, orientations, conformations and morphologies can be obtained. A further important aspect is the influence of annealing procedures, which is investigated in parallel. Overall, there will be more significant effort put into the art of creating new porous structures under different conditions. b) The properties of all the different systems achieved in (a) are investigated with surface analytical techniques, in particular SEM, XPS, AES, RBS, NRA, MEIS and ToF-SIMS. c) The key mechanisms leading to self-ordering (field effects, chemical effects, stress induced effects, etc.) have to be identified and investigated in order to understand better the driving forces for pore development, continued growth, and self-ordering. The investigations related to this milestone are performed at UM and at FAU, particularly with TEM and the surface analytical techniques mentioned in (b) and later work packages. These detailed studies are carried out on every new system that shows tube growth under certain conditions. This objective is therefore relevant to every system investigated and is an important part of the project throughout its overall duration. d) The possibility to exploit the self-organized TiO 2 nanotubes, with focus on solar-energy conversion (dye-sensitized solar cell), is addressed. The effect of doping and dye sensitization will be investigated in detail. The properties of self-organized TiO 2 nanotube layers and their performance, compared with currently used nanostructured systems produced by TiO 2 nanoparticle sintering, is determined in this step. The research related to this milestone is mainly carried out in Greece by Dr. P. Falaras's group at the NCSRD as they have the highest state of knowledge in this area. Nonetheless, researchers will be exchanged between the institutes in order to guarantee the exchange of knowledge and ideas. NCSRD provides the synthesis of new sensitizers presenting broad and intense metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption bands in the visible like Ru(II) complexes of bipyridine (bipy), terpyridine (terpy), phenanthroline and related ligands bearing carboxylic or phosphonic acid functional groups and their efficient incorporation (and optimisation) in dye-sensitised photoelectrochemical solar cells, having a solid-state structure and using polymer based redox NMP Priority 3 Specific Targeted Research Projects Ti-Nanotubes Project No: 033313, Final Activity Report-Full Duration 2 electrolytes. Surface chemical modification of the Ti-Nanotubes by noble metal deposition and N, S, P doping is performed for direct application in photocatalytic processes, including fabrication, modeling, and evaluation of photocatalytic reactors for efficient photodegradation of water (azo-dyes) and air pollutants (volatile organic compounds, VOCs). Eventually, superhydrophylic surfaces with self-cleaning and anti-fogging properties will be developed. This objective is split into two main parts: first, fundamental research on the newly developed systems from objectives a), b) and c) and their comparison in terms of the photo-response and second, the development of new photo-active nanotube-systems (ideas are based on the results obtained with the already investigated nanotube arrays) which in turn will be produced at the FAU (a). The main innovative aspect is the application of new nanotube-structures that have been produced by anodizing under different experimental conditions. The investigation methods performed in (b) and (c) gave a clear insight into the mechanisms of pore generation and growth and the investigations and application in (d) revealed aspects that are important for the technological improvement of the produced nanotubes. The different systems have been classified in terms of their technological value and new ideas for improvement of the systems can be developed and optimized simultaneously.},

Short-term storage, covering less than 1 h, offers only a small increase in the amount of electricity that can be absorbed by the network. Storage over periods of up to one day delivers greater energy benefits, but is significantly more expensive. Different feasible electricity storage technologies are compared for their operational suitability over different time scales. The value of storage in relation to power rating and energy capacity has been investigated so as to facilitate appropriate sizing.},

abstract = {Mutual inductance is a phenomenon caused by the circulation of the magnetic flux in the core of an electrical machine. It is the result of the effect of the current flowing in one phase on the other phases. In conventional three-phase machines, such an effect has no influence on the electrical behaviour of the device. Although these machines are powered by power inverters, no problem should occur. The result is not the same for multi-star machines. If these machines are using a conventional winding structure, namely distributed windings, and are powered by voltage source converters, current ripples appear in the power supply lines. These current ripples are related to magnetic couplings between the stars. Designers should check these current ripples in order to stay within the limits imposed by the specifications. These electric current disturbances also provide torque ripples. With concentrated windings, a new degree of freedom appears; the configuration—number of slots/number of poles—can have a positive impact. The circulation of the magnetic flux is the initial phenomenon that produces the mutual inductance. The main goal of this discussion is to describe a design method that is able to produce not only a machine with low mutual inductance between phases, but also a multi-star machine where the stars and the phases are magnetically decoupled or less coupled. This discussion only takes into $\backslash$r$\backslash$naccount the machines that use permanent magnets mounted on the rotor surface.

According to the good relation between the applied force to the armature and the inductance gradient (L'), the importance of this parameter calculation is obviously clear. There are several researchers who calculated L' using different numerical and analytical methods in these years. The analytical method to solve the simple problems is suitable, and numerical methods include sufficient coding time and programmer performance time. A method will be introduced in this paper to extract a formula or formulas of L' using structural railgun parameters which can cause the results similar to the results of the numerical methods. This method has not any time problem, and so, there is a good accuracy of data analysis. In this technique, which is called intelligent estimation method, according to the behavior of the railgun magnetism and its geometrical structure, an equation with unknown multiplications for L' formula is defined. Then, by applying the reported data in different studies for L', these equations can be found. Finally, the proposed method introduces a closed formula for a given structure of railgun.

The damage, which we call grooving, is localized to the region of the rails adjacent to the insulators. In this paper, we describe grooving damage observed in multiple tests using copper rails. In one series, in which we tested up to 20 shots on one pair of copper rails, we obtained grooves on the order of a millimeter deep and several millimeters wide.

abstract = {Current regulators for AC inverters are commonly categorized as hysteresis, linear PI, or deadbeat predictive regulators, with a further sub-classification into stationary ABC frame and synchronous d-q frame implementations. Synchronous frame regulators are generally accepted to have a better performance than stationary frame regulators, as they operate on DC quantities and hence can eliminate steady-state errors. This paper establishes a theoretical connection between these two classes of regulators and proposes a new type of stationary frame regulator, the P+Resonant regulator, which achieves the same transient and steady-state performance as a synchronous frame PI regulator. The new regulator is applicable to both single-phase and three phase inverters.},

By curving surface edges and strategically adding and subtracting material from the original armature, a new model was constructed that had a better current density distribution. Thus, altering the armature design could lead to reduced possibility of transition in the electromagnetic gun.},

abstract = {The research described in this thesis focuses on the mitigation of inter-turn$\backslash$nshort-circuit (SC) faults in Fault-Tolerant Permanent Magnet (FT-PM) machines. An analytical model is proposed to evaluate the inter-turn SC fault current accounting for the location in the slot of the short-circuited turn(s). As a mitigation strategy to SC faults at the design stage, a winding arrangement$\backslash$ncalled VSW (Vertically placed Strip Winding) is proposed and analysed. The proposed analytical model is benchmarked against finite element (FE) calculation and validated experimentally. The results demonstrate that the proposed$\backslash$nwinding arrangement in the slot improves the fault tolerance (FT) capability of the machine by limiting the inter-turn SC fault current regardless the fault location in the slot.$\backslash$nElectromagnetic and thermal studies are conducted to verify the merits and drawbacks of the proposed winding compared to the conventional winding using$\backslash$nround conductors (RCW). The study shows that the proposed winding$\backslash$nscheme, in addition to being fault-tolerant, has an improved bulk radial conductivity, can achieve a good fill factor, but has a significantly higher frequency-dependent AC copper loss. To predict the AC losses an analytical model based on an exact analytical 2D field solution is proposed. This model consists$\backslash$nof first solving the two-dimensional magneto-static problem based on Laplace's and Poisson's equations using the separation of variables technique. Then, based on that solved solution, by defining the tangential magnetic field$\backslash$n(Ht) at the slot opening radius, Helmholtz' equation is solved in the slot subdomain.$\backslash$nSubsequently, an FE and MATLAB{\textregistered} coupled parametric design is undertaken to maximise the VSW-wound machine's efficiency whilst maintaining its FT capability. The proposed analytical models for prediction of the SC fault current and AC copper losses are integrated into the coupled optimisation. It is shown that the effective losses of the VSW can be minimised through design parametric design while maintaining the required level of machine perfor-mance. Using an existing FT-PM machine of which the rotor is kept unchanged two stators were designed, manufactured and wound with RCW and VSW re-spectively and experimental tests are carried out to validate the analytical mod-els and the new winding concept.},

abstract = {The increasing penetration of wind power impacts the frequency stability of power systems. A doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind power plant naturally does not provide frequency response because of the decoupling between the output power and the grid frequency. DFIGs also lack power reserve margin because of the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) operation. Therefore this study presents a novel frequency regulation by DFIG-based wind turbines to coordinate inertial control, rotor speed control and pitch angle control, under low, medium or high wind speed mode. Inertial control emulates the inertia of wind generators and supports frequency control during transient. The gain of inertial control is calculated from a creative viewpoint of protecting the wind turbine from stalling. Rotor speed control and pitch angle control enable DFIGs to reserve sufficient active power for a steady-state frequency adjustment. The numerical simulations demonstrate that the coordinated control enhances the frequency regulation capability and damps the frequency oscillations effectively.},

abstract = {—This paper deals with the consequences of some manufacturing imprecision related to the use of a fractional-slot concentrated winding (FSCW) in recent permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) designs. Although these topologies improve the efficiency of mo-tors, they also lead to consider complex models, including undesirable harmonics, which can be strongly different from classical models expressed in a rotating frame. This may affect the control and the monitoring techniques used to detect some commonly reported faults such as turn short-circuit faults in the windings. Thus, adaptations are needed to improve classical fault detection methods. This paper considers an undesirable additional air gap, due to an imperfect manufacturing process, between the stator back iron and the teeth of a modular PMSM having an FSCW. A finite-element method and permeance network modeling are used to study the behavior of the machine. Good agreement is obtained between the two methods, validating the significant effects of such manufacturing faults on the behavior of the machine. Experimental tests confirm the occurrence of additional air gaps and their consequences on some classical interturn fault detection methods. Im-provements are also proposed in order to consider relevant indicators even in the presence of inherent manufacturing faults.

Existing approaches to analyzing such instability are based on inverter control models that account for the grid impedance and the coupling with other grid-connected inverters. A new method to determine inverter-grid system stability using only the inverter output impedance and the grid impedance is developed in this paper. It will be shown that a grid-connected inverter will remain stable if the ratio between the grid impedance and the inverter output impedance satisfies the Nyquist stability criterion. This new impedance-based stability criterion is a generalization to the existing stability criterion for voltage-source systems, and can be applied to all current-source systems. A single-phase solar inverter is studied to demonstrate the application of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Railgun recoil force is critical for efficient development and design. Several theoretical and experimental researchers have produced multiple published papers characterizing railgun recoil force. But these papers are not definitive and often conflict, so cannot explain the problem well. Simple breech-fed railgun is the simplest rail guns, and its mechanical properties are representative. Traditional theory suggests that recoil force of simple breech-fed railgun is caused by the breechblock conductor. It can not explain the fact that the measured recoil force is far less than the theoretical recoil. In this paper, the recoil force of simple breech-fed railgun is studied, in both cases of the breechblock conductor completely fixed with the rails and the breechblock conductor free movement. Based on the above two cases, authors propose a new theory that the breechblock conductor should be divided into two parts based on the state of motion: the fixed part and the free part. The force of the fixed part is the railgun recoil, and the force of the free is not the railgun recoil at all. Therefore the actual railgun recoil force is both of the two parts. The theory successfully explains why the measured recoil force is far less than the theoretical recoil forces, and it is useful to feed in the design of the breech-fed and recoil.},

This paper presents a system level design tool that optimises the power density (volume or mass) of a 3-phase, 2-level DC-AC converter. The design tool optimises the selection of the devices, heatsink and passive components (including the design of the line, EMI and DC-link filters) to maximise the power density. The structure of the optimisation algorithm has been organised to reduce the number of potential design combinations by over 99{\%}, and thus produces fast simulation times. The design tool predicts that when SiC devices are used instead of Si ones, the power density is increased by 159.4{\%}.

abstract = {The PEGASUS facility houses one of the railguns of the French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis (ISL). With its 10 MJ distributed energy storage and a 6 m long launcher tube, projectiles with a mass of several hundred grams are accelerated to muzzle velocities greater than 2000 m/s. The fiber brush armatures are supported by a sabot made of glass-fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP), an orthotropic insulating material with the best mechanical performance found so far. If the muzzle velocity is intended to be substantially increased, the sabot material may reach its mechanical limits due to the high dynamic loading. Hence a precise understanding of the material behavior will be necessary, especially with regard to the failure mechanisms that occur. The mechanical behavior of the sabot is analyzed by means of numerical simulation combining two 3D-finite-element codes: the electromagnetic code MEGA and the mechanical dynamic code LS-DYNA3D. The Lorentz force computed by MEGA is introduced into LS-DYNA3D as a time-and space-dependent volumetric load inside the brushes. By calculating the stress-strain distribution of the sabot, the regions which are liable to fail can be identified. The simulation results are validated by comparison with the experimental work using the X-ray photographs taken at the muzzle of the launcher. {\textcopyright} 2004 IEEE.},

abstract = { The aim of this paper is to analyze the stability problems of grid connected inverters used in distributed generation. Complex controllers (e.g., multiple rotating dq-frames or resonant-based) are often required to compensate low frequency grid voltage background distortion and an LCL-filter is usually adopted for the high frequency one. The possible wide range of grid impedance values (distributed generation is suited for remote areas with radial distribution plants) challenge the stability and the effectiveness of the LCL-filter-based current controlled system. It has been found out and it will be demonstrated in this paper that the use of active damping helps to stabilise the system in respect to many different kinds of resonances. The use of active damping results in an easy plug-in feature of the generation system in a vast range of grid conditions and in a more flexible operation of the overall system able to manage sudden grid changes. In the paper, a vast measurement campaign made on a single-phase system and on a three-phase system used as scale prototypes for photovoltaic and wind turbines, respectively, validate the analysis.},

abstract = {This thesis deals with thermal management aspects of electric machinery used in high-performance applications with particular focus put on electric machines designed for hybrid electric vehicle applications. In the first part of this thesis, new thermal models of liquid (water and oil) cooled electric machines are proposed. The proposed thermal models are based on a combination of lumped parameter (LP) and numerical methods. As a first case study, a permanent-magnet assisted synchronous reluctance machine (PMaSRM) equipped with a housing water jacket is considered. Particular focus is put on the stator winding and a thermal model is proposed that divides the stator slot into a number of elliptical copper and impregna- tion layers. Additionally, an analysis, using results from a proposed simplified thermal finite element (FE) model representing only a single slot of the sta- tor and its corresponding end winding, is presented in which the number of layers and the proper connection between the parts of the LP thermal model representing the end winding and the active part of winding are determined. The approach is attractive due to its simplicity and the fact that it closely models the actual temperature distribution for common slot geometries. An oil-cooled induction machine where the oil is in direct contact with the stator laminations is also considered. Here, a multi-segment structure is proposed that divides the stator, winding and cooling system into a number of an- gular segments. Thereby, the circumferential temperature variation due to the nonuniform distribution of the coolant in the cooling channels can be predicted. In the second part of this thesis, the thermal impact of using different winding impregnation and steel lamination materials is studied. Conven- tional varnish, epoxy and a silicone based thermally conductive impregnation material are investigated and the resulting temperature distributions in three small induction machines are compared. The thermal impact of using different steel lamination materials is investigated by simulations using the developed thermal model of the water cooled PMaSRM. The differences in alloy con- tents and steel lamination thickness are studied separately and a comparison between the produced iron losses and the resulting hot-spot temperatures is presented. Finally, FE-based approaches for estimating the induced magnet eddycurrent losses in the rotor of the considered PMaSRM are reviewed and compared in the form of a case study based on simulations. A simplified three-dimensional FE model and an analytical model, both combined with time-domain 2D FE analysis, are shown to predict the induced eddy current losses with a relatively good accuracy compared to a complete 3D FE based model. Hence, the two simplified approaches are promising which motivates a possible future experimental verification.},

The distribution of plasma in this region is affected by many factors, the magnetic field being the dominant one. In this paper, we analyze the magnetic field generated by rails and plasma armature in the interface regions, study the pattern and distribution of plasma near the interface and show the affect of magnetic field on plasma distribution and on the energy input to the rails. In order to reduce the initial ablation of the rail, we designed magnetic field coils outside the beginning part of the rails of our railgun. The coils enhance the initial magnetic field and increase the uniformity of the current distribution in the rails. Based on results from experiments and theoretical analysis, we propose a reasonable configuration of magnets and plasma armature},

abstract = {The increasing application of nonlinear loads may cause distribution system power quality issues. In order to utilize distributed generation (DG) unit interfacing converters to actively compensate harmonics, this paper proposes an enhanced current control approach, which seamlessly integrates system harmonic mitigation capabilities with the primary DG power generation function. As the proposed current controller has two well-decoupled control branches to independently control fundamental and harmonic DG currents, local nonlinear load harmonic current detection and distribution system harmonic voltage detection are not necessary for the proposed harmonic compensation method. Moreover, a closed-loop power control scheme is employed to directly derive the fundamental current reference without using any phase-locked loops (PLL). The proposed power control scheme effectively eliminates the impacts of steady-state fundamental current tracking errors in the DG units. Thus, an accurate power control is realized even when the harmonic compensation functions are activated. In addition, this paper also briefly discusses the performance of the proposed method when DG unit is connected to a grid with frequency deviation. Simulated and experimental results from a single-phase DG unit validate the correctness of the proposed methods.},

abstract = {In distributed energy production, permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSG) are often connected to the grid via frequency converters, such as voltage source line converters. The price of the converter may constitute a large part of the costs of a generating set. Some of the permanent magnet synchronous generators with converters and traditional separately excited synchronous generators could be replaced by direct-on-line (DOL) non-controlled PMSGs. Small directly networkconnected generators are likely to have large markets in the area of distributed electric energy generation. Typical prime movers could be windmills, watermills and internal combustion engines. DOL PMSGs could also be applied in island networks, such as ships and oil platforms. Also various back-up power generating systems could be carried out with DOL PMSGs. The benefits would be a lower price of the generating set and the robustness and easy use of the system. The performance of DOL PMSGs is analyzed. The electricity distribution companies have regulations that constrain the design of the generators being connected to the grid. The general guidelines and recommendations are applied in the analysis. By analyzing the results produced by the simulation model for the permanent magnet machine, the guidelines for efficient damper winding parameters for DOL PMSGs are presented. The simulation model is used to simulate grid connections and load transients. The damper winding parameters are calculated by the finite element method (FEM) and determined from experimental measurements. Three-dimensional finite element analysis (3D FEA) is carried out. The results from the simulation model and 3D FEA are compared with practical measurements from two prototype axial flux permanent magnet generators provided with damper windings. The dimensioning of the damper winding parameters is case specific. The damper winding should be dimensioned based on the moment of inertia of the generating set. It is shown that the damper winding has optimal values to reach synchronous operation in the shortest period of time after transient operation. With optimal dimensioning, interference on the grid is minimized.},

abstract = {The lecticans are a family of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans including aggrecan, versican, neurocan, and brevican. The C-terminal globular domains of lecticans are structurally related to selectins, consisting of a C-type lectin domain flanked by epidermal growth factor and complement regulatory protein domains. The C-type lectin domain of versican has been shown to bind tenascin-R, an extracellular matrix protein specifically expressed in the nervous system, and the interaction was presumed to be mediated by a carbohydrate-protein interaction. In this paper, we show that the C-type lectin domain of brevican, another lectican that is specifically expressed in the nervous system, also binds tenascin-R. Surprisingly, this interaction is mediated by a protein-protein interaction through the fibronectin type III domains 3-5 of tenascin-R, independent of any carbohydrates or sulfated amino acids. The lectin domains of versican and other lecticans also bind the same domain of tenascin-R by protein-protein interactions. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that brevican lectin has at least a 10-fold higher affinity than the other lectican lectins. Tenascin-R is coprecipitated with brevican from adult rat brain extracts, suggesting that tenascin-R and brevican form complexes in vivo. These results demonstrate that the C-type lectin domain can interact with fibronectin type III domains through protein-protein interactions, and suggest that brevican is a physiological tenascin-R ligand in the adult brain.},

This paper deals with the use of another type of high magnetic field sensor based on thin ({\&}lt;1 mum) manganite films, which exhibit the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) effect. This sensor measures the magnitude of the magnetic induction and can have very small sensitive areas (e.g., 0.5 mmtimes50 mum). Some basics about CMR and the design of the sensor are given. Several sensors were used in experiments performed with the ISL-launcher EMA3 (E{\textless}sub{\textgreater}prim {\textless}/sub{\textgreater}=0.6 MJ, l=3 m, cal=15 mmtimes30 mm). Transient magnetic field profiles with rise times of approximately 50 mus and amplitudes up to 4 T were recorded. The results obtained with the CMR sensors are compared with those of conventional loop sensors. Also, some metrological peculiarities due to high-frequency coupling to the detector circuit are mentioned. The highly local measurements of these CMR sensors were validated by results obtained from 3-D finite element (FE) calculations of the magnetic field distributions},

abstract = {Smart grids are often analyzed using a top-down approach, i.e., starting from communication and control technologies evolution, to then focus on their effects on active and passive users, in terms of new services, higher efficiency and quality of supply. However, with their bottom-up approach, virtual power plants (VPP) are very promising instruments for promoting an effective integration of distributed generation (DG) and energy storage devices as well as valid means for enabling consumers to respond to load management signals, when operated under the supervision of a scheduling coordinator. These aggregation factors can be very profitable for the distributed energy resources (DERs) economy and for the energy network itself. This paper presents a new algorithm to optimize the day-ahead thermal and electrical scheduling of a large scale VPP (LSVPP) which contains: a) many small-scale producers and consumers (“prosumers”) distributed over a large territory and b) energy storage and cogeneration processes. The algorithm also takes into account the actual location of each DER in the public network and their specific capability. Thermal and electrical generator models, load and storage devices are very detailed and flexible, as are the rates and incentives framework. Several novelties, with respect to the previous literature, are proposed. Case study results are also described and discussed},

The demagnetization fault causes flux-density difference and changes the PMSM inductances. Such varying parameters make it difficult to detect and diagnose the exact severity of a demagnetization fault. In this paper, we suggest a use of structural analysis of the PMSMs to diagnose the demagnetization fault. We can calculate varying inductances and consider the magnetic saturation effect with varying flux linkages of the machine. Combination of the proposed technique with the least-square (LS) method shows better results than the conventional methods in the estimation of flux linkages in the PMSMs with the demagnetization fault. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method works well both in the tracking of varying inductances and the diagnosis of the demagnetization fault.},

The model contains representations of the permanent magnet generator, the frequency converter system with control, the aerodynamic rotor and a lumped mass representation of the shaft system. This model complexity is needed for investigations of the short-term voltage stability and ride-through capability of such wind turbines. Ride-through capability is a major issue and, for the given concept, can be achieved by applying blocking and restart sequences to the frequency converter at the voltage drop in the power grid.

abstract = {An electromagnetic railgun is one of the applications of electromagnetic launchers, which are devices used to accelerate projectiles to velocities exceeding those attained with conventional propelling systems. A magnetic field is generated when current flows through two conductive rails connected by a moving armature. The current that passes through the rails exerts an electromagnetic force on the armature and causes it to accelerate to high speeds. In this work, a three-dimensional transient model for the thermal and electromagnetic solutions of the launch process is presented. The model accounts for the determination of the current and temperature profiles inside the rails, the projectile movement, and the cooling process after the first launch. Focus is given to the thermal management where five different arrangements, one without cooling and four that include cooling channels, are studied. A 10 to 50K reduction in the peak temperature was obtained with the inclusion of cooling channels when compared to the no-cooling-channel case. It was also shown that the position and size of these channels can be optimized in order to reduce this peak temperature.},

abstract = {Distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) is one of the well-known and effective strategies adopted in distribution network. The goal of DFR problem is to obtain a new topological structure for distribution feeders by rearranging the status of switches such that an optimal configuration would be obtained. The existence of Distributed Generation (DG) can affect the entire power system and especially distribution networks. This paper presents an efficient approach for multi-objective DFR problem considering the simultaneous effect of DG units. The objective functions to be investigated are 1) power losses, 2) voltage deviation of buses, 3) emission produced by DG units and distribution companies and 4) the total cost of the active power generated by DG units and distribution companies. The new evolutionary method is based on an efficient multi-objective hybrid honey bee mating optimization (HBMO) and shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) called MHBMO-SFLA. The proposed hybrid algorithm integrates the outstanding characteristics of SFLA to improve the performance of HBMO algorithm sufficiently. In the proposed MHBMO-SFLA, an external repository is considered to save non-dominated solutions which are found during the search process. Also, since the objective functions are not the same, a fuzzy clustering technique is utilized to control the size of the repository within the limits. A distribution test feeder is considered to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} Shiraz University.},

The total cost function, which includes the cost of ESS, cost of output power and cost of spinning reserve, is introduced. The effectiveness of the approach is validated by a case study where the optimal ESS rating for MG is determined. The quantitative results show that the ESS with an optimal size is not only storing renewable energy and re-dispatching it appropriately, but also saving the the total cost for MG. The main method is formulated as a mixed nonlinear integer problem (MNIP), which is solved in AMPL (A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming).},

The torque characteristic of the machine allows a prediction of reference flux linkage for the next sampling time-step. By estimating this flux linkage, the necessary average phase voltage for the next PWM-period can be calculated to control a constant instantaneous torque output. Moreover, the sampling time of the control can be extended, which allows implementation on low cost microcontrollers. Furthermore, a novel strategy of torque prediction is proposed, which allows complete elimination of inherent torque ripple during phase commutation, without using offline-calculated current or flux profiles. The functionality of this strategy is verified by computer simulation and experiments},

Open magnetic circuit VSM measurement results were applied to determine the magnet intrinsic properties. The HDHM developed originally for electrical steel hysteresis modeling is adopted for ferrite PM material. FEA-based results for magnetic field strength in PMs of a tooth coil winding RSM PMSM under ideal sinusoidal and frequency converter supplies were used as input data for the HDHM and the hysteresis losses were calculated in the machine's magnets. Differently from NdFeB and SmCo PMs ferrite PMs do not seem to demonstrate significant hysteresis behavior. It was found that the hysteresis loss could be neglected in ferrite PMs in most PMSM designs if the magnet is fully polarized.},

abstract = {Many electromagnetic launcher experiments have been conducted with
armature-rail pairs made of dissimilar alloys. When the armature is made
of an aluminum alloy, the eventual formation of aluminide intermetallics
is likely at the sliding contact interfaces with nonaluminum rails.
Because most launcher bores are freely accessed by laboratory air, other
reactions-oxidation, nitridation, and water vapor-may also occur during
the reactive phase of the transfer of aluminum from the armature to the
rail surface. The structure and composition of the thin layer that
adheres to the rail contact surfaces is important, because it separates
the new armature contact in a subsequent launch from the original rail
contact surfaces and, thus, affects current transfer and the contact
lubrication process. The chemistry and the morphology of the reaction
layer on the rails will vary along the length of the launcher. In the
armature start-up and low-velocity regions of the rails, the adhering
rail deposit shows evidence of liquid-metal-enhanced, high-temperature
reactions. Experimental data confirming the,presence of these reaction
products are presented for the case of the very low-speed and highly
energetic propulsion of a copper armature between aluminum alloy rails.
A copper aluminide intermetallic-CuAl2-is formed, as predicted from the
binary phase diagram. Intermetallics have properties that will degrade
the multishot load-carrying capability of rail conductors.},

Steady state principles of both types are analyzed and mathematical modeling of crucial components is described. The behavior and operation of the system during stochastic wind speed series is simulated using software tools Matlab and Power Factory. The two configurations are accessed based both on the steady state characteristics and the control system designs. The paper covers a wide range of control methods, which are implemented in both wind turbine schemes. Regarding the PMSG scheme, an advanced damping controller to damp possible oscillations excited in the drive train is presented and its contribution to the safe operation of the wind turbine is explained.

abstract = {This paper presents the design process of a slotted TORUS axial-flux permanent-magnet motor suitable for direct drive of an electric vehicle through sizing equation and Finite Element Analysis. AFPM motor is a high torque density motor which can be easily and compactly mounted into the automobile's wheel fitting the rim perfectly. A double-sided slotted AFPM motor with 6 rotor poles for high torque density and stable rotation is the preliminary design. In order to determine the design requirements, a simple vehicle dynamic model evaluating the vehicle performance considering an automobile's typical-trip cursing scenario is considered. Axial-flux permanent-magnet machine's fundamental theory and sizing equation are applied to obtain the initial design parameters of the motor with the highest possible torque. The FEA of designed motor was conducted via commercial Vector Field Opera-3D 14.0 software for evaluation and accuracy enhancement of the design parameters. FEA simulation results are compared with those results obtained from sizing equation showing a good agreement of flux density values in various parts of the designed motor at no-load condition. The motor meets all the requirements and limitations of the electric vehicle fitting the shape and the size of a classical rim of the vehicle wheel.},

With the appropriate power converter, DER can provide ancillary services such as frequency control and voltage support. This paper outlines the economic potential of DERs coordinated in a microgrid to provide reactive power and voltage support at its point of common coupling. The DER Customer Adoption Model assesses the costs of providing reactive power, given local utility rules. Depending on the installed DER, the cost minimizing solution for supplying reactive power locally is chosen. Costs include the variable cost of the additional losses and the investment cost of appropriately over-sizing converters or purchasing capacitors. A case study of a large health care building in San Francisco is used to evaluate different revenue possibilities of creating an incentive for microgrids to provide reactive power.},

The proposed IMMD topology reduces the segment voltage and offers an opportunity to utilize wide bandgap 200V GaN MOSFETs. Consequently, a reduction in IMMD size is achieved by eliminating inverter heat sink and optimizing the choice of DC-link capacitors. Gate signals of the IMMD segments are shifted (interleaved) to cancel the capacitor voltage ripple and further reduce the capacitor size. Motor winding configuration and coupling effect are also investigated to match with the IMMD design. An actively controlled balancing resistor is programmed to balance the voltages of series connected IMMD segments. Furthermore, this paper presents simulation results as well as experiment results to validate the proposed design.},

In the main part of the paper different solutions that provide frequency response have been analysed. Both conventional and alternative solutions have been described and their technical parameters have been presented. It has been shown that the available energy and maximum available power for the initial inertia response are limited in case of conventional generators. On the contrary the alternative solutions providing synthetic inertia (SVC PLUS Frequency Stabilizer and battery storages) are limited only by the amount of the energy stored and their rated power. It has been shown that from the technical as well as from an economic and environmental point of view the SVC PLUS Frequency Stabilizer and battery storage can provide the needed synthetic inertia in order to mitigate large frequency deviations. Furthermore, on comparing the SVC PLUS Frequency Stabilizer and battery storages it has been shown that for short time applications in range of several seconds (typical duration before the primary response starts) the SVC PLUS Frequency Stabilizer has significant economical and footprint advantages over battery solutions. This is mainly due to application of the supercaps as short time power storage technology.},

Field records are also obtained and evaluated to verify that the optical systems can replace conventional instrument transformers. In addition, OCT step response as well as the impact of ambient temperature on the OCT performance has been investigated. Results show that optical CTs are more than suitable for replacing conventional CTs. Further, the results also show that OCT has better frequency response than conventional CT. Differences found in the field and laboratory measurements are within experimental errors. Unlike the conventional CT, the OCT can have a digital output according to the IEC 61850 standard. The digital output of the OCT is tested for its frequency-amplitude characteristic. Results confirm that digital output has a narrower bandwidth than the low energy analog output of the OCT due to the limited sampling rate prescribed in a UCA guide to IEC-61850-9-2.},

Due to the increasing number of DPGSs connected to the utility network, new and stricter standards in respect to power quality, safe running, and islanding protection are issued. As a consequence, the control of distributed generation systems should be improved to meet the requirements for grid interconnection. This paper gives an overview of the structures for the DPGS based on fuel cell, photovoltaic, and wind turbines. In addition, control structures of the grid-side converter are presented, and the possibility of compensation for low-order harmonics is also discussed. Moreover, control strategies when running on grid faults are treated. This paper ends up with an overview of synchronization methods and a discussion about their importance in the control},

abstract = {Cogging torque in permanent-magnet machines causes torque and speed ripples, as well as acoustic noise and vibration, especially in low speed and direct drive applications. In this paper, a general analytical expression for cogging torque is derived by the energy method and the Fourier series analysis, based on the air gap permeance and the flux density distribution in an equivalent slotless machine. The optimal design parameters, such as slot number and pole number combination, skewing, pole-arc to pole-pitch ratio, and slot opening, are derived analytically to minimize the cogging torque. Finally, the finite-element analysis is adopted to verify the correctness of analytical methods.},

The obtained results reveal a severe dispersal in terms of SC robustness: some devices were able to support SC of a very long duration but others failed immediately, for the same electrical and thermal initial constraints. In order to understand this dispersal, static characterizations and collapse-related measurements have been carried out on a large number of devices from the same manufacturer with the same blocking voltage and different current ratings. Then, destructive shortcircuits were launched on these transistors. Finally, the time leading to failure (TLF) for a given DC voltage was correlated with the parameters extracted from the characterizations.},

abstract = {In order to reduce size and cost, high-order passive filters are generally preferred in power converters to cancel out high frequency harmonics caused by pulse width modulation. However, the filter resonance peaks may require the use of passive dampers to stabilize the interactions between the load and source impedances. Furthermore, the stabilizing effect is more difficult to be guaranteed for cost-optimized filters, which are characterized by low inductance and high capacitance passive components. In this paper, several passive filter topologies used to interface voltage source converters with the utility grid are reviewed, and evaluated in terms of damping capability, stored energy in the passive components and power loss in the damping circuit. Additionally, the influences of different switching frequencies of power converters on the passive filter design are also discussed in the range of 1-15 kHz. Illustrative design examples of the passive filters and experimental data are also provided.},

abstract = {In direct-drive electric propulsion systems, where there is no reduction gear to minimize and absorb the adverse effects of cogging torque generated by the permanent-magnet (PM) machine, minimization of cogging torque generation is of particular importance. In this paper, a novel axial pole-pairing method is proposed to minimize cogging torque generation in a special three-phase outer-rotor PM brushless machine, which uses uneven stator poles to enhance back electromotive force (EMF). Analytical formulas of the machine's cogging torque are first derived. The new technique is compared with conventional cogging torque suppression methods by means of analytical models and comprehensive finite-element analysis (FEA). The FEA results show that the new method not only achieves effective cogging torque reduction, but also results in improved harmonic content of the back EMF. The validity of the FEA model is verified by experimental results from the prototype machines. Finally, the significance of optimizing both the load-independent machine design techniques and load-dependent driving techniques to achieve overall torque ripple minimization is discussed.},

An electric energy with a maximum value of 10 MJ can be supplied by a high-power capacitive storage. The current is injected at 13 locations distributed along the barrel. Projectiles or launch packages in the mass range of 1 to 4 kg were designed in order to obtain both a good electrical and mechanical performance and tested with the PEGASUS facility. The sabot consists of a metal fiber brush armature embedded in an insulating low-density structure made of a glass/epoxy composite material. In the mass range of about 0.3 kg these sabots equipped with eight metal-fiber brushes (without payload) are able to achieve muzzle velocities up to 2200 m/s without any damage to the glass/epoxy structure due to the acceleration process. The tungsten alloy rods used as payload were placed in front of the sabot, i.e., they were screwed or bonded into the composite structure. A structural analysis of the sabot containing the tungsten rod was performed with the mechanical dynamic FE-Code LSDYNA3D. The calculated three-dimensional stress state inside the sabot composite structure shows that the critical stresses are essentially located in the interface region of the bore for the rod. Solutions are proposed to reduce the high stresses and transferred to the projectile design. Experimental observations using flash radiographs taken at the muzzle of the railgun show that the payload rods can be launched correctly},

abstract = {In heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems of medium/high cooling capacity, energy demands can be matched with the help of thermal energy storage (TES) systems. If properly designed, TES systems can reduce energy costs and consumption, equipment size and pollutant emissions. In order to design efficient control strategies for TES systems, we present a model-based approach with the aim of increasing the performance of HVAC systems with ice cold thermal energy storage (CTES). A simulation environment based on Matlab/Simulink is developed, where thermal behaviour of the plant is analysed by a lumped formulation of the conservation equations. In particular, the ice CTES is modelled as a hybrid system, where the water phase transitions (solid-melting-liquid and liquid-freezing-solid) are described by combining continuous and discrete dynamics, thus considering both latent and sensible heat. Standard control strategies are compared with a non-linear model predictive control (NLMPC) approach. In the simulation examples model predictive control proves to be the best control solution for the efficient management of ice CTES systems. 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Permanent-magnet (PM) motors offer potential energy savings as compared with induction motors because of the virtual elimination of rotor loss and the reduction of stator loss from operation near unity power factor. In PM machines, iron losses form a significant fraction of the total loss partly due to the nonsinusoidal flux density distribution. Design optimization therefore requires good means of predicting these iron losses. Finite-element analysis can be employed but this approach is cumbersome and costly when used in the many iterations needed in optimizing the design. This paper presents a set of improved approximate models for the prediction of iron loss. They can be used in design optimization programs and, since they are directly related to machine dimensions and material properties, they also provide quick insight into the effects of design changes. A time-stepped finite-element method is employed to evaluate the iron losses in a range of typical PM machines and the results are used to evaluate the adequacy of the models. The predictions of overall iron losses are then compared with measurements made on two PM motors.},

However, the power mismatch from cascaded individual PV converter modules can bring in voltage and system operation issues. This paper addresses these issues, explores the effects of reactive power compensation and optimization on system reliability and power quality, and proposes coordinated active and reactive power distribution to mitigate this issue. A vector method is first developed to illustrate the principle of power distribution. Accordingly, the relationship between power and voltage is analyzed with a wide operation range. Then, an optimized reactive power compensation algorithm (RPCA) is proposed to improve the system operation stability and reliability, and facilitate MPPT implementation for each converter module simultaneously. Furthermore, a comprehensive control system with the RPCA is designed to achieve effective power distribution and dynamic voltage regulation.

abstract = {This paper proposes an improved analytical switching process model to calculate the switching loss of low-voltage enhancement-mode Gallium Nitride high-electron mobility transistors (eGaN HEMTs). The presented eGaN HEMTs models are more or less derived from silicon MOSFETs models, whereas eGaN HEMTs are different from three aspects: higher switching speed, much more reduced parasitic inductance in switching loop, and absence of reverse recovery. Applying the traditional model to eGaN HEMTs results in inaccurate prediction of switching waveforms and losses. The proposed model considers the effect of low-parasitic inductances, nonlinearity of junction capacitances, and nonlinearity of transconductance. The turn-on and turn-off switching processes are described in detail and the resulting equations can be easily solved. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by comparing the predicted switching waveforms and converter's efficiency with the experimental results, respectively. Based on the analytical model, the effects of gate resistance, gate supply voltage, and parasitic inductances on switching losses are investigated. Meanwhile, a novel current measuring method based on magnetic coupling is proposed to measure the switching current waveform with improved accuracy.},

The concept of distributed FACTS devices, as an alternative approach to realizing cost-effective power flow control, has been recently proposed. This paper discusses the design considerations for implementing distributed power control solutions on the power grid, with specific examples for series var compensation, and the significant impact it can have on grid utilization and system reliability.

Feasible slot/pole combinations of the fractional-slot concentrated winding six-phase PMSM are elicited and analyzed for scheme selection. The novel 24-slot/14-pole combination is derived from the analysis and suppression of the magnetomotive force (MMF) harmonics. By making use of alternate-teeth-wound concentrated winding configuration, two adjacent coils per phase and unequal teeth widths, the phase windings of the proposed machine is magnetically, thermally isolated, which offers potentials of modular design and fault tolerant capability. Taking advantage of the leakage component of winding inductance, 1.0 per unit short-circuit current is achieved endowing the machine with short-circuit proof capability. Optimal design of essential parameters aiming at low eddy current losses, high winding factor and short-circuit-proof ability are presented to pave the way for a high-quality system implementation.},

abstract = {The integration of an electrical machine and power electronics promises many benefits, the largest being an increase in power density. The use of system integration may lead to an increase in loss density and local or component temperatures. For this reason much attention needs to be paid to the thermal design aspects of the system. In the aerospace industry weight and reliability are of significant importance. In this paper the integration of a permanent magnet machine and power electronics into a single structure with joint thermal management is investigated. An overall goal of 2 kW/kg is set for system power density. Additionally in this paper fault tolerance is introduced into the design. This will allow the system to continue functioning should a single electrical fault occur. Principle faults are identified and discussed. A 50 kW, 6 phase, 8 pole permanent magnet machine is presented with a rotor speed of 50 krpm. A symmetrical phase shifted full bridge is used to drive the permanent magnet machine, aiding the functionality of fault tolerance and enabling the use of soft switching. A mathematical model for both machine and power electronics is created and used to calculate phase currents and losses in the machine and power electronics. Finally, spatial integration and thermal management concepts are presented and analysed.},

abstract = {Electromagnetic (EM) launch science and technology in the United States continues to advance at a significant pace. The computational and experimental tools for understanding the critical physics issues are sufficiently mature that they are being utilized to provide insight and resolution of the remaining major technical challenges. For example, the primary computational electrodynamics code, EMAP3D, is now implemented in a hybrid finite element-boundary element configuration with moving conductors, providing faster computation and increased understanding of these complex systems. An increased focus on railgun tribology and experiments to understand the interface between railgun armatures and the rail surface is providing important insight for improved railgun lifetimes. Control algorithms for counter-rotating pulsed alternators have been developed and validated experimentally with physical scale simulators. Solid-state switches are replacing the more traditional vacuum switches for high-current and high-voltage railgun power sources. Silicon is the material of choice, but silicon carbide shows great promise for reduced size and increased electrical performance. As a consequence of these and other advances, the U.S. Army has initiated an effort to build a power source with a matched pair of counter-rotating pulsed alternators and a cantilevered railgun to accelerate projectiles to 2-MJ kinetic energy. The U.S. Navy has initiated a new effort to launch large projectiles to hypervelocity. Because of the large naval platform, the size and weight of the power source are not significant issues for the U.S. Navy, whose primary interest is in providing precision fire support to ranges in excess of 200nmi (500 km). The critical technical issues in implementing this application for the Navy are railgun bore lifetime and high-acceleration-tolerant guidance and control. This paper highlights the recent major achievements in hypervelocity physics, pulsed power, and railgun life-$\backslash$ntimes that provide the critical science and technology underpinnings for the Army and Navy EM gun programs},

abstract = {As a growing number of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Wind Turbine Generations (PMSG-WT) are integrated into the modern power grid, there has been a great concern for system operators who expects PMSG-WT to play an active role in the primary frequency regulation when frequency event occurs. However, PMSG-WTs are still unable to provide any additional active power in response to the system frequency change. In this work, a control scheme of coordinated frequency regulation for DFIG is redesigned and implemented into a PMSG-WT model by synthesizing the inertial control, over-rotor speed control and pitch angle control. Inertial control emulates the total inertia response of both wind turbine and generator to provide a short-term frequency support. According to the de-loaded optimum power extraction curve, the over-rotor speed and pitch angle controls are coordinated to maintain the reserved power and meanwhile assist the primary frequency regulation in a long-term period. The coordinated control strategy of PMSG-WT comprises the low, medium and high wind speed modes. By this means, the comprehensive control method will promote the PMSG-based wind farms to effectively participate in the system frequency regulation under a full scope of wind speed conditions.},

abstract = {Globally, buildings are responsible for 40{\%} of the total world annual energy consumption which is responsible for one-third of green house gas emissions around the world. A significant portion of this energy is used for lighting, heating, cooling, and air conditioning purposes in buildings. Increasing awareness of the environmental impact of green house gas emissions and CFCs triggered a renewed interest in environmentally friendly cooling, and heating technologies for buildings. Free cooling of buildings may be seen as an alternate to compressor based air conditioning systems used for the buildings. In free cooling, nighttime cold is accumulated in storage material and extracted when needed. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs) can be used for free-cooling purposes due to their high storage density. In free cooling, using PCM as storage material, cool air during night is used to solidify the PCM and the accumulated cold is extracted during the hot day times. In this article a detailed review of work conducted by different researchers on PCM based free cooling is presented. Major challenges being faced in the design of PCM based free cooling system such as phase change materials; their thermo-physical properties and the geometry of encapsulation are elaborated and discussed in detail. Also the parameters effecting the charging and discharging of PCM, effect of phase change temperature and climatic conditions on thermal performance of the free cooling system are also discussed. Potential reduction in CO2 emissions due to the applicability of free cooling systems in residential and commercial buildings is also discussed in this article. This paper also provides a comprehensive list of the PCMs currently being used and that can be used potentially for free cooling applications. At last, this paper also presents some current problems needed further research in this area. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Finite element analysis of the motor is carried out to obtain output torque of the motor. It is found that the output torque ripple of the machine when supplied with sinusoidal currents is considerably high. An optimum control technique is presented to operate the machine with minimum torque ripple and least stator ohmic loss. Furthermore, an optimum fault tolerant control method under open-circuit fault conditions is presented. Due to the half bridge and split capacitor configuration used for this modular motor drive the neutral voltage fluctuates considerably during the fault condition. To solve this problem, a constraint to make the summation of the phase currents to zero is incorporated in the derivation of the fault tolerant optimal control strategy. Optimal currents are calculated for normal and open-circuit fault-tolerant operation of the machine. Simulation results are presented for the verification of the control methods. Although the control techniques discussed in this work are applied for the five phase modular permanent magnet machine, they can be extended for multiphase permanent magnet machines with any number of phases.},

abstract = {The performances of the P+Resonant controller in case of current control for a single phase grid connected inverter have been proved to be superior to the PI controller, since it is able to remove the phase error of the control at the fundamental frequency of the grid. It offers also the possibility of selective harmonic compensation. However, in case of digital implementation on a low-cost fixed-point DSP, the limited computational power and the limited numerical representation precision can restrict the utilization of it. The present paper proposes a different way of digital implementation of the P+Resonant controller with selective harmonic compensation on a low-cost fixed-point DSP. The resonant part of the P+R has been implemented as a second order filter based on delta operator. The current controller, together with harmonic compensation for the 3{\textless}sup{\textgreater}rd{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, 5{\textless}sup{\textgreater}th{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, and 7{\textless}sup{\textgreater}th{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} harmonics has been successfully tested in practice with a 1.5 KW PV inverter, achieving a 1.2{\%} total harmonic distortion (THD) of the grid current.},

abstract = {This paper investigates differences of parasitic inductances caused by DC bus bar patterns on printed circuit boards(PCB). The DC bus bar pattern on the PCB is limited depending on the layout of main circuits and the control circuits. Two patterns which are a laminated wiring pattern and a plane wiring pattern are compared in experiments and simulations. In this paper, it will be clarified that effects of the DC bus bars on PCBs such as a surge voltage of a switch in terms of the parasitic inductance depending on the circuits on PCBs. As a result, if the same parasitic inductance which is 20 nH, is realized between each wiring pattern at the same length, the plane wiring pattern requires over ten times of the pattern width compared with that of the laminated wiring pattern. Hence, the circuit size can be downsized when the laminated pattern is used. From the experimental results, the maximum surge voltage in the plane wiring pattern is larger than that in the laminated wiring pattern. In this case, the parasitic inductance value of the plane wiring pattern is three times that of the laminated wiring pattern. However, the surge voltage in the laminated pattern is reduced by 7{\%} compared with the plane wiring pattern. As a consequence, the ratio of the surge voltage does not match that of the parasitic inductance. As a result, not only the parasitic inductance of the DC bus bar but also it is necessary to consider other parasitic inductances on PCBs such as parasitic inductances into input capacitors and the path between an upper MOSFET and a lower one and so on.},

abstract = {In electric vehicle (EV) inverter systems, direct-current-link capacitors, which are bulky, heavy, and susceptible to degradation from self heating, can become a critical obstacle to high power density. This paper presents a comprehensive method for the analysis and comparative evaluation of dc-link capacitor applications to minimize the volume, mass, and capacitance. Models of equivalent series resistance that are valid over a range of frequency and operating temperature are derived and experimentally validated. The root-mean-square values and frequency spectra of the capacitor current are analyzed with respect to three modulation strategies and various operating conditions over practical ranges of load power factor and modulation index in EV drive systems. The modeling and analysis also consider the self-heating process and resulting core temperature of the dc-link capacitors, which impacts their lifetimes. Based on an 80-kW permanent-magnet (PM) motor drive system, the application of electrolytic capacitors and film capacitors has been evaluated by both simulation and experimental tests. The inverter power density is improved from 2.99 kW/L to 13.3 kW/L, without sacrificing the system performance in terms of power loss, core temperature, and lifetime.},

abstract = {Globally, buildings are responsible for 40{\%} of the total world annual energy consumption which is responsible for one-third of green house gas emissions around the world. A significant portion of this energy is used for lighting, heating, cooling, and air conditioning purposes in buildings. Increasing awareness of the environmental impact of green house gas emissions and CFCs triggered a renewed interest in environmentally friendly cooling, and heating technologies for buildings. Free cooling of buildings may be seen as an alternate to compressor based air conditioning systems used for the buildings. In free cooling, nighttime cold is accumulated in storage material and extracted when needed. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs) can be used for free-cooling purposes due to their high storage density. In free cooling, using PCM as storage material, cool air during night is used to solidify the PCM and the accumulated cold is extracted during the hot day times. In this article a detailed review of work conducted by different researchers on PCM based free cooling is presented. Major challenges being faced in the design of PCM based free cooling system such as phase change materials; their thermo-physical properties and the geometry of encapsulation are elaborated and discussed in detail. Also the parameters effecting the charging and discharging of PCM, effect of phase change temperature and climatic conditions on thermal performance of the free cooling system are also discussed. Potential reduction in CO2 emissions due to the applicability of free cooling systems in residential and commercial buildings is also discussed in this article. This paper also provides a comprehensive list of the PCMs currently being used and that can be used potentially for free cooling applications. At last, this paper also presents some current problems needed further research in this area. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The primary goal of these experiments was to launch a dual-armature launch package in the two-turn configuration while maintaining electrical isolation between the rail and armature pairs. Two tests with the dual-armature launch package on a single-turn configuration independently examined the performance of the launch package. Results of those tests showed good thermal and structural performance of the armature assembly and no melt transfer between the armature contact regions. Five tests were then conducted on the two-turn rail configuration. During the second test, the crossover that connects the two rail pairs at the breech suffered arcing damage at the rail contacts. A new crossover was fabricated, and all subsequent tests were successful with no crossover arcing. The final system had a propulsive inductance gradient of 1.8 muH/m, with projectiles successfully launched in excess of 400 m/s at linear current densities up to 35 kA/mm.},

A generalized 2D-approach taking into account turbulent friction, radiative and turbulent heat transfer and spatial inhomogeneity of the magnetic field was used. The heat regime of electrodes was considered in the 2D-approach. The momentum and energy transfer from the flow core to the electrodes and the process of involving the erosion mass into acceleration were investigated in detail. It has been shown that magnetic field inhomogeneity causing the appearance of spatial induction currents influences essentially the momentum, energy and mass balance in the near-electrode region and the armature characteristics as a whole. It leads to an additional drag force and the release of Joule heat near the rail surface and to the increase in erosion. Under some conditions this can cause instability of plasma armature and its sharp extension. Calculations have shown that the electrode melting, destruction of the liquid film, involving of drops into acceleration and their vaporization in the flow seem to be the most probable mechanism of plasma mass increase for typical regimes of railgun operation},

abstract = {This paper presents the design of a high-voltage hybrid generator (HG) and conversion system for wind turbine applications. The HG combines wound field (WF) and permanent magnet (PM) rotor excitations. At any given speed, the PM induces a fixed stator voltage, while the WF induces a variable controlled stator voltage. The HG alternating output is rectified via a passive rectification stage; hence, the machine net dc output voltage is controlled over a prescribed, but a limited range. The split ratio between PM and WF rotor sections is considered as varying from a fully WF rotor, or traditional synchronous generator, to some ratio of PM to WF excitation. The turbine operational characteristics and maximum wind velocity variations between turbines in a wind farm are used to define the WF to PM split ratio. Both a three-phase and a nine-phase stator winding design are investigated. The nine-phase winding results in 4.2{\%} higher output RMS voltage that yields a more power dense solution. It further yields lower rectified dc-link voltage ripple. The HG mass, loss audits, and efficiency discussions are presented. In order to investigate the feasibility of the HG concept, a small scale laboratory prototype is designed, and operational test results presented that show good agreement with the simulation model results. {\textcopyright} 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The goal of this phase of our investigation of better rail materials was to assess the multiple shot performances of copper-silver alloy (Cu-24{\%} Ag) test coupons. The focus of these tests was on the assessment of changes in material properties and microstructure of test coupons. The primary metric used was the change in hardness. Material surface deformations and microstructure changes were evaluated by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Hardness gradually increased as the number of tests increased. Test coupons in four states were studied: pre-test; after one pulse test; after three pulse tests; and after eight pulse tests. The changes in hardness are related to the initial state of strain and dislocation distributions in the test specimens. The hardness is changed by the nucleation of new strain-free crystallites within the heavily worked, dislocation-dense grain structure. An annealing, recrystallization, and re-straining model is proposed to predict the bandwidth within which the hardness will fluctuate. The retained hardness of the copper-silver alloy test coupons has an average value that corresponds to a tensile strength greater than 650 MPa (100 ksi). This is well above the 500-MPa strength of the usual contacting aluminum alloy armature. Based on these test data, it is concluded that copper-silver remains an attractive material for use as a strong and thermally stable conductor},

abstract = {This paper describe a design method of an LCL filter for the three-phase two-level voltage-source PWM converters. The grid current harmonics regulation is the primary condition for the operation of the grid-connected converters to satisfy. If the grid voltage is assumed to be ideally sinusoidal, PWM switching is the only factor to produce harmonics on the grid current, especially around the bands of the switching frequency. However, every single harmonic cannot be evaluated for the filter design. In this paper, it is found that there exists the most significant harmonic frequency at which the harmonic current is dominant. Theoretical description of the PWM waveform and the transfer function of the filter's impedance are needed for the derivation of the most significant frequency. Once the most significant frequency is recognized, the total inductance to satisfy the grid current harmonic regulations is determined by selecting proper resonant frequency. Along with the information of the designed total inductance and preset resonant frequency, additional conditions such as the filter's total energy, converter current ripple and converter capacity are utilized to specify the values of each component of the filter. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with simulation and experimental results.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.The superconducting inductive pulsed-power supply (SPPS) circuit consists of a high-temperature superconducting pulsed-power transformer (HTSPPT) and an auxiliary capacitor. The electrical losses and the power of the primary source can be cut down with the superconducting inductive energy storage. Although its energy density is slightly less than a purely superconducting inductive system, it can reduce the maximum voltage of the opening switch by the capacitor and achieve a high degree of current amplification factor. However, during the discharge process, the magnetic leakage flux energy stored in the primary of the HTSPPT requires the capacitor to have a certain capacity. The higher the ratio of the capacitive stored energy over the total inductive stored energy, the more the dominant position of inductive energy storage reduces. The current amplification factor ($\gamma$), the maximum voltage of the opening switch (VS max), and the ratio of capacitive stored energy ($\eta$) are the three main properties of the SPPS circuit, which depends on several intertwined critical parameters, such as the inductance ratio n = L2/(L2+LL) and the capacitance (C1). This paper studies the influence of the critical parameters on the main circuit performance with a 1-kJ SPPS system. The detailed selection method of the critical parameters for the specific system is also discussed with a coupling coefficient of 0.95. Such a system is easy to be utilized for the basic experimental study of a small railgun.},

@article{Antler1981,
abstract = { The wear of metallic contacts occurs by adhesion, abrasion, brittle fracture, fretting, and delamination processes. Adhesive wear can be in mild or severe regimes and is promoted by surface cleanliness and contact pressure. The severe adhesive wear mechanism in early sliding ofAu, Pd, Ag, Sn, SnPb alloys, and many other metals is prow formation, characterized by the transfer of metal from the member with the larger surface involved in sliding to the smaller. On repeat-pass movement a transition to rider wear occurs in which the direction of metal transfer reverses. Prow formation occurs readilywith ductile metals because it requires a large growth of mating asperities. Neither the hardness nor the presence of codeposited polymer in pure or alloy gold e!ectrodeposits is as significant as their ductility in determining performance. Codeposited polymer is not a lubricant, but it may inhibit plastic flow of the metal, reducing ductility and thereby indirectly minimizing the tendency to adhesive wear. Golds that contain a few tenths of a percent of cobalt or nickel from dc-plated acid cyanide baths have good adhesive wear resistance. Abrasive wear of a metal occurs when it is slid against a rough hard surface. Ductile metals resist fracture during abrasion; both high hardness and ductility are desirable. Wrought metals, such as inlays, are generally more durable than the cobalt and nickel dc gold electrodeposits in abrasive wear. Fretting, or oscillatory sliding through a small amplitude, leads quickly to high contact resistance with base metals, because oxide debris accumulates between the members. Fretting may also degrade the contact resistance of mated connectors if gold finishes on their contacts wear through, thereby exposing the base substrate. Delamination wear, which appears first as a substrate, then as surface cracks, followed by the loosening of surface material, contributes to contact failure in fretting. Hard substrates and underplates are desirable because they reduce adhesive, abrasive, and fretting wear. Smooth surfaces are superior to rough surfaces when adhesive and abrasive wear can occur.},

Motor winding configuration and coupling effect are also investigated to match with the IMMD design.

abstract = {Active rectifiers/inverters are becoming used more and more often in regenerative systems and distributed power systems. Typically, the interface between the grid and rectifier is either an inductor or an LCL-filter. The use of an LCL-filter mitigates the switching ripple injected in the grid by a three-phase active rectifier. However, stability problems can arise in the current control loop. In order to overcome them, a damping resistor can be inserted, at the price of a reduction of efficiency. The use of active damping by means of control may seem attractive but it is often limited by the use of more sensors compared to the standard control and also by a complex tuning procedure of the controllers. This paper introduces a new active damping method that does not require the use of more sensors. It consists of adding a filter on the reference voltage for the modulator. The tuning process of this filter is easily done, for a wide range of sampling frequencies, with the use of genetic algorithms. This method is used only for the optimum choice of the parameters in the filter and an on-line implementation is not needed. Thus the resulting active damping solution does not need new sensors or complex calculations. Moreover, in the paper particular attention is devoted to the susceptibility of the system in a high polluting environment.},

In this paper, sensorless speed control of a dc motor was performed by using extended Kalman filter (EKF) and particle filter (PF). The speed information is estimated by using armature current data measured from a dc motor which is controlled in various speed references with a closed-loop controller. Furthermore, a performance comparison of the EKF and the PF by taking into consideration their estimation errors under the same conditions was realized in a simulation environment. The comparison results showed that the estimation performance of the PF is more accurate but slower than the EKF. The quantitative values of accurateness and slowness are depended on the particle number of the PF. The obtained computation times of the PF having ten particles and the EKF are 180 and 15 $\mu$s, respectively.},

In order to suppress resonance and guarantee good performance, many strategies (e.g. active damping (AD), harmonic resonant control, repetitive control and grid feedforward) have been proposed. However, the wide variation of grid impedance value challenges system stability in practical applications. The aforementioned methods need to be investigated. This study evaluates the applicability of each part of the overall control in a weak grid case with the use of a stability criterion. It has been demonstrated that the feedback-based AD control can work well in a wide range of grid conditions. However, the resonant and repetitive control methods meet constraints. The grid feedforward method brings in an extra positive feedback path, and consequently results in high harmonics or even instability. Finally, a recommendation for system design has been presented.

The issue of MPPT has been addressed in different ways in the literature but, especially for low-cost implementations, the perturb and observe (P{\&}O) maximum power point tracking algorithm is the most commonly used method due to its ease of implementation. A drawback of P{\&}O is that, at steady state, the operating point oscillates around the MPP giving rise to the waste of some amount of available energy; moreover, it is well known that the P{\&}O algorithm can be confused during those time intervals characterized by rapidly changing atmospheric conditions. In this paper it is shown that, in order to limit the negative effects associated to the above drawbacks, the P{\&}O MPPT parameters must be customized to the dynamic behavior of the specific converter adopted. A theoretical analysis allowing the optimal choice of such parameters is also carried out. Results of experimental measurements are in agreement with the predictions of theoretical analysis.},

abstract = {This paper describes a five-phase brushless dc (BLDC) motor designed for an electrohydrostatic actuation system (EHA) suited to the thin and optimized wings. The foundation of the design is a motor with fault tolerance and high reliability, compact structure, and low weight. The motor power rating is 12 kW at 12 000 rpm, and a “wet” form of construction is used where hydraulic oil is present in the motor to reduce the number of oil seals of the EHA for enhanced reliability and lifetime. The losses and thermal behavior are evaluated for an optimized design. Fault tolerance for BLDC motors is discussed. A five-phase motor has been manufactured, and test results are presented to validate the design.},

abstract = {A novel virtual inertia control utilizing cascaded multilevel inverter (CMI) based STATCOM for wind power generation is presented in this paper. Although wind power is a promising renewable energy source, its intermittent character has caused some difficulties for grid-connected and islanded operation. As wind plants (WP) installations are at an emergent pace, they must also contribute to maintain stability and reliability of the power system. However, the rotating mass of variable-speed wind turbines is decoupled from the grid frequency. Thus, it does not inherently exhibit an inertial frequency response (IFR) unless controlled for that specific purpose. In this paper, the comparison between traditional synthetic inertia control (SIC) and proposed novel virtual inertia control (VIC) is demonstrated. A Matlab/Simulink model of DFIG-based WP equipped with CMI-based STATCOM is presented. Both theoretical and simulated results are provided.},

abstract = {Irreversible demagnetisation of a permanent magnet (PM) at high temperature can be caused by the field distributions because of the stator currents. It can be prevented if the magnet thickness is sufficient. However local irreversible demagnetisation can occur even if the magnet thickness is sufficient. The local irreversible demagnetisation is varied according to the magnetic path. To analyse the cause of local irreversible demagnetisation, the authors introduced an interior PMSM (IPMSM), consisting of a V-shaped magnet and concentrated winding, and performed a parameter analysis of the magnetic field based on the barrier width and magnet position considerably related to the magnetic path using the finite-element method. On the basis of the results, the authors developed a model avoiding local irreversible demagnetisation. A maximum load test was performed after a thermal saturation test to confirm whether irreversible demagnetisation of the manufactured models occurred. Finally, to verify the validity of the finite-element analysis (FEA) results, the torque, efficiency, power factor and induced voltage of the manufactured model, which were obtained by FEA, were compared with the test results.},

abstract = { The acceleration in electromagnetic railguns of projectiles with a mass of several hundreds of grams up to velocities ranging between 2000 m/s and 3000 m/s requires currents with intensities of several MA. In the ISL rail launchers the repulsion forces created by these currents acting on the rails of the launcher can reach values in the order of 20 MN/m. The housing of the launcher has to withstand these high mechanical stresses to maintain the rails in position and thus to keep the caliber constant. In this paper a comparative study of different possibilities of housings is presented. The limits of the actual fiber wound materials are shown and a selection of new insulating materials capable of withstanding the mechanical stresses is given. We also present the concept of a housing made of insulated steel plates allowing a good mechanical stiffness combined with a minimum loss due to eddy currents in steel. In particular, we show that the good mechanical behavior of the steel plate housing makes it possible to reach the same overall efficiency as that obtained with a fiber-wound material housing.},

abstract = {Electricity generated from renewable sources, which has shown remarkable growth worldwide, can rarely provide immediate response to demand as these sources do not deliver a regular supply easily adjustable to consumption needs. Thus, the growth of this decentralized production means greater network load stability problems and requires energy storage, generally using lead batteries, as a potential solution. However, lead batteries cannot withstand high cycling rates, nor can they store large amounts of energy in a small volume. That is why other types of storage technologies are being developed and implemented. This has led to the emergence of storage as a crucial element in the management of energy from renewable sources, allowing energy to be released into the grid during peak hours when it is more valuable. The work described in this paper highlights the need to store energy in order to strengthen power networks and maintain load levels. There are various types of storage methods, some of which are already in use, while others are still in development. We have taken a look at the main characteristics of the different electricity storage techniques and their field of application (permanent or portable, long- or short-term storage, maximum power required, etc.). These characteristics will serve to make comparisons in order to determine the most appropriate technique for each type of application. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The target application of this 150 Nm machine is to provide a means of directly powering the main rotor blades of a concept compound rotor wing UAV. The application requirements are high torque per weight, low torque ripple, a compact external- rotor configuration integral to the rotor hub, air-cooling and fault tolerance. Fault tolerance is achieved by configuring the machine radially as four separate three-phase star connected windings. Analytical and finite element analysis, as well as prototype testing and results, are presented for normal working and different fault scenarios showing the benefit of the configuration in minimising torque ripple and additional losses during faulted operation.},

abstract = {There have been sporadic efforts to use electricity to power guns and launch projectiles at high velocity for more than a century. Each generation seems to have “reinvented” the idea and has built upon prior efforts, leading to successively greater progress. With the present interest in electric guns for military, and other, applications, it is instructive to review previous developments and examine their relevance to present research. Although there are isolated reports of early efforts in the 19th century, the major developments have been in the 20th century. They include efforts in Norway in 1901, French developments in World War I and research in Germany and Japan during World War II. The primary focus of this paper is to review the work of Andre Louis Octave Fauchon-Villeplee in France and Joachim Hansler in Germany, although the early Japanese and Russian interests are also mentioned. The various novel ideas suggested are highlighted, especially where they are relevant to ideas that are being studied or considered today},

On the other hand, a multilayer perceptron feedforward network (trained by a backpropagation algorithm) that works as a hysteresis band comparator is used.

@article{JiabinWang2008,
abstract = {This paper describes the merits of a recently developed form of a three-phase permanent-magnet (PM) brushless AC machine in which the concentrated coils of each stator phase are wound either on adjacent teeth or on alternate teeth. Such a machine is often referred to as modular and offers a number of significant advantages over conventional PM brushless machines. For example, it results in a smaller number of slots for a given number of poles, which is a distinct manufacturing advantage, and yields a fractional number of slots per pole, which is conducive to low cogging torque. It also enables a significant increase in the achievable machine inductance to facilitate constant power operation over a wide speed range by flux weakening. However, the torque in modular machines is developed by the interaction of a high-order stator space harmonic MMF with the PMs, since the fundamental stator MMF has fewer poles than the PM rotor. Hence, significant eddy currents may be induced in the rotor by the fundamental and low-order space harmonic MMFs. The eddy-current loss can, however, be reduced by segmenting the magnets. Given that modular machines combine the high specific power and efficiency of conventional PM brushless machines with a high machine inductance, to enable a wide speed range, constant power operation, their potential for low manufacturing cost, and the fact that they have inherently low cogging torque, they are eminently suitable for in-wheel traction applications.},

@article{Musgrove1983,
abstract = {The global wind-energy resource is very large and widely distributed; and, within Europe, wind energy has the potential to provide an energy output equal to about three times the present electricity consumption. Although the wind is not very reliable as a source of power from day to day, it is a reliable source of energy year by year, and the main role for future wind-energy systems will be operating in parallel with electricity grid systems or, in remote locations, in parallel with diesel engines, so saving fuel. Systems integration studies indicate that existing utility grid systems could accept a contribution of about 20{\%} from wind turbines, although, with changes to the future plant mix, the potential contribution is substantially greater: and similar percentage fuel savings are possible in remote locations with wind/diesel systems. Recent progress in the development of wind turbines is reviewed and the cost data now becoming available indicates that medium-sized machines, i.e. ? 20?40 m diameter and with power ratings in the range 50?500 kW, offer the most attractive economics for land-based applications in the near future, giving energy costs in the range 2.8?5.6 p/kWh, for a typical site where the annual average wind speed is 5.5 m/s (measured at the normal 10 m height); in windier locations energy costs will be lower. Corresponding capital costs for installed wind turbines are in the range 锟?50?1500/kW (with average outputs equal to about 30{\%} of the rated). The UK, in common with some other countries, has a large offshore wind-energy potential, but, to be economically competitive, offshore systems will need to use multimegawatt wind turbines with diameters of 100 m and larger. Prototype machines in this size range already exist, but considerable further development is needed before the construction of large offshore wind turbine arrays can commence, although this is a realistic prospect for the 1990s. The economics of wind-energy conversion systems are alr- eady encouraging, and commercial applications already in evidence, most notably in the USA and Denmark where more than 2000 wind turbines with a total installed capacity in excess of 150 MW have been installed in the past two years. However, further operational experience is required to demonstrate that reliable operation can be sustained over periods of many years. As this experience is accumulated, and as the cost benefits associated with quantity production are achieved, the market for wind turbines can be expected to expand rapidly.},

GaN performance at elevated temperature is especially unique. Turn-on time increases significantly with temperature, and turn-on losses increase as a result. This phenomenon can be explained based on the relationships between junction temperature and GaN device transconductance, and between transconductance and turn-on time. An analytical relationship between temperature and turn-on loss has been derived for the 650-V GS66508 from GaN Systems, and verified with experimental results. Based on this relationship, a detailed model is developed, and a simplified scaling factor is proposed for estimating turn-on loss in e-mode GaN HFETs, using room-temperature switching characterization and typically published datasheet parameters.},

abstract = {Wind power is still the most promising renewable energy in the year of 2013. The wind turbine system (WTS) started with a few tens of kilowatt power in the 1980s. Now, multimegawatt wind turbines are widely installed even up to 6–8 MW. There is a widespread use of wind turbines in the distribution networks and more and more wind power stations, acting as power plants, are connected directly to the transmission networks. As the grid penetration and power level of the wind turbines increase steadily, the wind power starts to have significant impacts to the power grid system. Therefore, more advanced generators, power electronic systems, and control solutions have to be introduced to improve the characteristics of the wind power plant and make it more suitable to be integrated into the power grid. Meanwhile, there are also some emerging technology challenges, which need to be further clarified and investigated. This paper gives an overview and discusses some development trends in the technologies used for wind power systems. First, the developments of technology and market are generally discussed. Next, several state-of-the-art wind turbine concepts, as well as the corresponding power electronic converters and control structures, are reviewed, respectively. Furthermore, grid requirements and the technology challenges for the future WTS are also addressed.},

abstract = {Compared with the state-of-the-art Si-based power devices, enhancement-mode Gallium Nitride (E-mode GaN) transistors have better figures of merit and exhibit great potential in enabling higher switching frequency, higher efficiency, and higher power density for power converters. The bridge-leg configuration circuit, consisting of a controlling switch and a synchronous switch, is a critical component in many power converters. However, owing to the low threshold voltage and fast switching speed, E-mode GaN devices are more prone to false turn-on phenomenon in bridge-leg configuration, leading to undesirable results, such as higher switching loss, circuit oscillation, and shoot through. In order to expand gate terminal's safe operating margin without increasing reverse conduction loss during deadtime, negative gate voltage bias for turn-off and antiparallel diode could be applied to E-mode GaN device. In this paper, with consideration of strong nonlinearities in C-V and I-V characteristics of high-voltage (650 V) E-mode GaN transistors, analytical device models are first developed. Then, we develop an analytical circuit model that combines the circuit parameters with intrinsic characteristics of the high-voltage GaN transistor and antiparallel diode. Thus, key transient waveforms with regard to the false turn-on problem can be acquired, including displacement current and false triggering voltage pulse on gate terminal. The simulated waveforms are then verified on a testing board with GaN-based bridge-leg circuit. In contrast to piece-wise switching process models and PSpice simulation, the proposed model exhibits outstanding performances. To provide design guidelines for mitigating false turn-on of GaN transistor, the impacts of different circuit parameters, along with the optimum negative gate voltage bias, are investigated based on the proposed model.},

abstract = {Methods to modify power system dynamics through the addition of synthetic inertia have gained increasing research attention over the past several years. Many researchers justify this focus by implicitly assuming that adding inertia increases a system's stability, and only focusing on the frequency nadir as a measure of performance. In this paper, we draw attention to the fact that adding synthetic inertia to a power system may not always increase the system stability when considering overall small signal behavior. We apply two different sets of dynamic parameters to the generators in the IEEE 14-bus test system and show an example in which increasing synthetic inertia exercised through loads may lead to problematic instabilities.},

With the superb switching performance of GaN power FETs, a reduction in IMMD size is achieved by eliminating inverter heat sink and optimizing dc-link capacitors. Gate signals of the IMMD modules are interleaved to suppress the total voltage ripple of dc-link capacitors and to further reduce the capacitor size.

The WBG devices are capable of operating at high junction temperature ( {\textless} 170 °C) with improved efficiency due to fast switching speed and low on-state resistance. It also leads to better performance and higher power density electrohydrostatic actuators than the traditional solutions, which are being widely adopted in industrial applications such as aerospace, robotics, automobiles, manufacturing, wind turbine, and off-road vehicles.

Such a procedure for model identification is essential for better usage of readings from smart meters, which is expected to be installed in almost all buildings in the coming years. The models can be used for different purposes, e.g. control of the indoor climate, forecasting of energy consumption, and for accurate description of energy performance of the building. Grey-box models based on prior physical knowledge and data-driven modelling are applied. This facilitates insight into otherwise hidden information about the physical properties of the building. A hierarchy of models of increasing complexity is formulated based on prior physical knowledge and a forward selection strategy is suggested enabling the modeller to iteratively select suitable models of increasing complexity. The performance of the models is compared using likelihood ratio tests, and they are validated using a combination of appropriate statistics and physical interpretation of the results.

abstract = {This paper investigates the capacitor-current-feedback active damping for the digitally controlled LCL-type grid-connected inverter. It turns out that proportional feedback of the capacitor current is equivalent to virtual impedance connected in parallel with the filter capacitor due to the computation and pulse width modulation (PWM) delays. The LCL-filter resonance frequency is changed by this virtual impedance. If the actual resonance frequency is higher than one-sixth of the sampling frequency (fs/6), where the virtual impedance contains a negative resistor component, a pair of open-loop unstable poles will be generated. As a result, the LCL-type grid-connected inverter becomes much easier to be unstable if the resonance frequency is moved closer to fs/6 due to the variation of grid impedance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a capacitor-current-feedback active damping with reduced computation delay, which is achieved by shifting the capacitor current sampling instant towards the PWM reference update instant. With this method, the virtual impedance exhibits more like a resistor in a wider frequency range, and the open-loop unstable poles are removed; thus, high robustness against the grid-impedance variation is acquired. Experimental results from a 6-kW prototype confirm the theoretical expectations.},

experiments were carried out to verify the correctness of the railgun
circuit model. Influence of different electric parameters of PPS on
muzzle velocity was analyzed by the computer aided circuit design
program PSPICE based on this model. The parameters include capacitance,
equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the capacitor, inductance, and
jitter time of the thyristor. The simulation results show that the ESR
is the most critical influencing factor (the deviation of velocity is
-4.286{\%} when the ESR is 5 m Omega). The following is the change of the
capacitance (the deviation of velocity is -3.827{\%} when the capacitance
decreases to 95{\%} C-0). In the meantime, the changes of the resistance
of inductor do have an influence on muzzle velocity (the deviation of
velocity is -0.908{\%} when the resistance of inductor is 1 m Omega).
However, the changes of inductance and the jitter time of the thyristor
impose no significant effect on muzzle velocity. The conclusions provide
reference to the overall optimization of PPS design and quality control
of the manufacturing process.},

abstract = {Gallium nitride high electron mobility transistors (GaN HEMTs) are promising switching devices in high-efficiency and high-density dc-dc converters due to their fast switching speed and small conduction resistance. However, GaN HEMTs are very sensitive to parasitic inductance because of their high switching speed, low-threshold voltage, and small driving safety margin. Parasitic inductance can cause severe voltage overshoot and ringing, whichmay result in electromagnetic interference issues, false turnon, or even device breakdown. This paper aims at reducing the parasitic inductance (including power loop inductance and driver loop inductance) by optimizing the layout. First, a multiloop method is proposed to reduce the parasitic inductance. Optimization of both the conventional single-loop structure and the proposed multiloop structure are presented. Second, three kinds of power loop layouts based on the proposed multiloop structure are realized on PCB substrate and one of them is realized on aluminum nitride (AlN) substrate, which has higher thermal conductivity but less copper layers. The power loop inductance on PCB substrate is reduced to 0.1 nH, which is only 25{\%} of the state-of-art layout. The power loop inductance on AlN substrate is reduced to 0.22 nH. Third, the driver loop layout is optimized and achieves 50{\%} reduction of driver loop inductance compared with the conventional single-layer layout. Finally, integrated modules using the proposed layouts are built to validate the analyses and designs.},

The net thermal effect of each shot is to raise the bulk temperature and induce thermal stresses in the conductors. While the high bulk temperature reduces the strength of the material, the cyclic thermal stress may reduce fatigue cycle life of the components. Various estimates of cooling requirements in rail conductors have been done using one-dimensional and two-dimensional approximations. In this study, we carried out a three-dimensional motion computation of the thermal load experienced by the entire length of a laboratory electromagnetic gun for a single shot firing. The distribution of thermal energy deposited in the rails is compared with the prior solutions. Post-transition energy dissipation and voltage rise due to arcing contact are also characterized.},

displacement. A longer arm length can result in better flexibility and
lower contact force. The effect of the electromagnetic force versus the

abstract = {Gallium Nitride High Electron Mobility Transistor (GaN HEMT) is an emerging wide band gap power device in recent years. Using a cascoded structure, the GaN HEMT can be combined with a low voltage MOSFET to make the combination behave as a normally-off device. This paper investigates the soft-switching behavior of cascode GaN HEMT in the phase-leg structure. The analysis reveals some internal device behaviors during the soft-switching transition, which are not found in the non-cascode device. Due to the internal feedback of the cascode structure, the channel current of the internal GaN HEMT drops to zero quickly, leading to extremely low turn-off loss. However, it has been found that there are switching energy loss dissipated in the internal GaN HEMT during the turn-on transient, although the external waveforms of the cascode GaN HEMT exhibit zero voltage switching. The fundamental reason is that ratio of the sum of MOSFET output capacitance and internal GaN HEMT input capacitance to the internal GaN HEMT output capacitance is quite low. Based on the simulation, by adding additional capacitance on the gate source terminals of internal GaN HEMT, these losses can be mitigated. Experimental tests using a commercially available GaN device are presented which show nearly 400 mW of loss at 1 MHz switching frequency in four different load current conditions.},

abstract = {The authors identify and characterize a velocity and efficiency limiting effect called contact velocity skin effect (VSEC) which occurs in the interface of a railgun's sliding contact. Despite enormous contact forces, the armature will remain separated from the rail by a thin adsorbed layer, on the order of 10 to 15 angstroms in this investigation. Electrical conduction through the layer is via quantum tunneling which is more resistive than classical conduction through the conductor. A comprehensive theory to account VSEC is presented and is applicable to all constant gradient electromagnetic launchers. The theory not only accounts for the velocity-limit effect, but also predicts a maximum efficiency. Theoretical parameters include the inductance gradient, system resistance, projectile velocity, and sliding contact area. Theoretical predictions are compared to experimental data from a conventional and an augmented railgun. The augmented railgun is a 3-turn augmented system with 40 mm bore x 750 mm length typically operating at 250 kA peak current with a projectile velocity of 300 m/s. The conventional railgun is 40 mm bore x 4000 mm length which typically operates at 850 kA with a projectile velocity of 1600 m/s. The characterization of VSEC predicts velocity saturation and efficiency roll-off in electromagnetic launchers and provides new insights into EML operation and physics especially with regard to the armature and its contacts.},

that there is no true motional emf in railguns, and offer a resolution
of the conflicting views in terms of localized flux creation.

The use of wideband III-nitride (such as GaN) devices today is limited to telecom and low-power applications. The current lack of high-frequency high-power drivers prevents their application in power converters. The proposed circuit is based upon resonant switching transition techniques, by means of an LC tag, to recover part of the power back into the voltage source in order to reduce the power loss. This circuit also uses level shifters to generate the zero and negative gate-source voltages required to turn the GaN HFET on and off, and it is highly tolerant to input-signal timing variances. The circuit reduces the overall power consumed in the driver and thus reduces the power loss. This is particularly important for high-frequency driver operation to take full advantage, in terms of efficiency, of the superior switching speed of GaN devices. In this paper, the topology of the low-power-loss high-speed drive circuit is introduced. Some simulation results and preliminary experimental measurements are discussed.},

abstract = {The most important part of a railgun launch package is the armature
where the electromagnetic force is generated leading to the acceleration
of the launch package. In case of metal armatures, the most commonly
used armature types are the C-shape and the multifiber brush technology.
However, rarely both armature types were systematically compared under
similar experimental conditions. That is why we constructed launch
packages based on the C-shaped and brush armature technology with
comparable armature and payload mass. With these launch packages, a
series of experiments was performed in an energy range between 0.8 MJ
and 1.13 MJ corresponding to a speed range between 950 m/s and 1400 m/s.
The results of the experiments were then analyzed qualitatively and
quantitatively. On the one hand, our results showed that the total
losses are higher for the C-shaped armature technology than for the
brush armature technology. On the other hand, our results showed that
launch packages based on the C-shaped technology convert better
electrical energy into kinetic energy.},

abstract = {In this paper, optimal phase advances under fault-tolerant control (FTC) of a five-phase permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motor (PMa-SynRM) have been proposed under different fault conditions. Critical applications where the consistency and safety are the major concerns in automotive and aerospace industries require reliable control systems. The multiphase motor is considered a promising candidate for these applications as it has redundant phases primarily for fault-tolerant operation. However, advanced FTC for a PMa-SynRM with maximization of reluctance torque has been limitedly studied until now. In the conventional approach, to maintain constant magnetomotive force under fault conditions, phase currents of a motor need to increase significantly. However, this will easily saturate the PMa-SynRM resulting in significantly reduced reluctance torque. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel phase current control method that maximizes the reluctance torque with minimum phase current. Here, a phase current control with a novel phase advance has been proposed under various fault conditions. Extensive theoretical and experimental analysis has been carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed idea with 5-hp dynamo system controlled by TI DSP F28335. {\textcopyright} 1982-2012 IEEE.},

Electromagnetic rail launcher(EMRL) will enjoy a promising future in the military application because it has many advantages compared with conventional weapons, such as high muzzle velocity, energy sources facility, easily controlling, excellent work capability etc. One of the main problems of electromagnetic rail launcher is the heating to melt in some special places of the rail and armature, and the rail launcher will be disabled. In this paper, the working principle of the EMRL is analyzed. With finite element analysis code the simulation model of the EMRL is set up and electromagnetic-thermal coupled analysis of the EMRL is accomplished. The laws of current distribution, EM force distribution and temperature distribution of the armature vs. time are achieved. The varying laws of EM force and temperature in armature resulting from its loads changing are also analyzed. All of these results will provide guidance for the following engineering project.},

The grating-polarizer is employed to convert the polarization plane's rotation of a linearly polarized light into the rotation of a circular facula, which then be converted into the horizontal linear movement of a linear facula by an image converter. Thus, a Faraday rotation angle can be measured directly by positioning the dark stripe in the facula. A 110-kV prototype with the rated current 300 A is completed, and trail run on the line.

In this way the stiffness requirements of the rotor and the stator are drastically reduced, which leads to large mass savings in the mechanical structure and enables a further diameter increase, which then results in mass reductions also in electrically active parts. The design is based on excitation by use of rare-earth permanent magnets. In other aspects the electrical design is conventional.},

@article{Shatoff2007,
abstract = {A moving armature railgun code (called HERB) has been developed for coupled electromagnetic, thermal and structural fields using the general purpose code ANSYS as the underlying computational engine. This analysis uses shifted electromagnetic fields to simulate the velocity effects associated with such motion (akin to EMAP3D [1]). Specifically, the velocity effects are produced by the shift of the magnetic vector and scalar potential fields, the temperature and structural fields, and the respective element material attributes. The cylindrical symmetry of the model allows us to employ 3D finite element bricks. These have an advantage over tetrahedral elements by allowing very high aspect ratios to model longer stretches of the problem not in the immediate vicinity of the armature or the end of the rails, with a minimal number of elements, thereby reducing both the model size and the required computational time. The armature motion is calculated self-consistently from the electromagnetic forces on the armature; however, the armature is stationary. Instead the electromagnetic, thermal and structural degrees of freedom, as well as the element material attributes of the non-armature components of the model are shifted to simulate the motion. It is these other non-armature components that move but in the direction opposite to the actual armature motion. The method has been verified for electromagnetic velocity effects using several simple modified textbook cases of closed wire loops moving through either uniform or spatially dependent magnetic fields. In both cases the agreement between the ANSYS and analytical results was very good. In addition, the model has been verified against published EMAP3D coupled electromagnetic railgun results with good agreement. Using ANSYS has many benefits. ANSYS is commercially available, validated and maintained. Further it has fully developed pre and post processors, multi-elements, and multiple field types that can be readily coupled re- - quiring no further user development. Moreover, ANSYS is being continuously improved and updated and comes equipped with full technical support. In addition, the user can add more physics via a relatively straightforward Fortran-like scripting language.},

To reach long ranges, muzzle velocities in excess of 2000 m/s with projectile flight mass of 16 kg and above are needed. Relatively high firing rates are desired; typically 6-12 rounds per minute, so substantial power demands will be made on the ship. For an electrically driven ship, as in the DD(X) concepts presently being explored by the Navy, an existing electrical infrastructure would be in place that could be modified to recharge the pulsed power supplies for the railgun. This study focused on the railgun, the pulsed power system needed to drive the gun, the power system needed to restore the energy required to match the firing rate, and special ship interfaces. Railgun concepts and sizing for the NSFS mission were undertaken, and research and development issues of importance for the success of a future system were identified. Recommendations for analytical and experimental studies that should be undertaken to further address these issues are provided.},

abstract = {A model previously developed to investigate current and heat transport in solid-armature railguns is extended. The model is two dimensional and involves the solution of coupled Maxwell and heat transport equations in both the armature and rails. The principal extensions include the development of a transformation that maps an armature of fairly arbitrary shape in a rectangular computational region, and the inclusion of melting within the appropriate governing equations. The model is applied to analyze an armature under recent experimental study. Temperature and induction-field profiles are calculated as functions of both space and time. Recent experimental data, indicative of the performance of the armature, are also presented and correlated where possible with results of the calculations},

abstract = {Smart grids are often analyzed using a top-down approach, i.e., starting from communication and control technologies evolution, to then focus on their effects on active and passive users, in terms of new services, higher efficiency and quality of supply. However, with their bottom-up approach, virtual power plants (VPP) are very promising instruments for promoting an effective integration of distributed generation (DG) and energy storage devices as well as valid means for enabling consumers to respond to load management signals, when operated under the supervision of a scheduling coordinator. These aggregation factors can be very profitable for the distributed energy resources (DERs) economy and for the energy network itself. This paper presents a new algorithm to optimize the day-ahead thermal and electrical scheduling of a large scale VPP (LSVPP) which contains: a) many small-scale producers and consumers (“prosumers”) distributed over a large territory and b) energy storage and cogeneration processes. The algorithm also takes into account the actual location of each DER in the public network and their specific capability. Thermal and electrical generator models, load and storage devices are very detailed and flexible, as are the rates and incentives framework. Several novelties, with respect to the previous literature, are proposed. Case study results are also described and discussed},

This paper presents a filter-capacitor current feedback control scheme for grid-connected converter. The controller is consisted of a proportional-resonance regulator and a proportional regulator. Unlike the existing control strategy with unit capacitor current feedback, the proposed method applies the proportional regulator to the feedback path, which can decouple these two regulators, and simplify the tuning process. Controller parameters are tuned with the aid of root-locus of system close-loop transfer function, which can provide better grasp of the influence of individual parameters and make the design process visible and holistic without any simplification and assumption. The validity, reasonability and feasibility of the control strategy and the proposed current controller design method are verified by the simulation results of a 50kVA grid-connected inverter.},

abstract = {Currently, assemblies of power semiconductor switches and their associated drive circuitry are available in modules. MOSFETs and IGBTs are used as switches and these elec- tric gated devices facilitate the incorporation of gate driving functions in the module. These mod- ules are sometimes also provided with limited internal sensing and protection functions. From a few 100 watts downward, one finds silicon monolithic technology as the integration vehicle, while upward into the multi-kilowatt range, mixed mode module construction is used. This incorporates monolithic, hybrid, surface mount and wirebond technology. However, a close examination of the applications in motor drives and power supplies indicates that there has been no dramatic volume reduction of the subsystem. The power semiconductor modules have shrunk the power switching part of the converter, but the bulk of the subsystem volume still comprises the associated control, sensing, electromagnetic power passives (inductors, transformers, capacitors) and interconnect structures. The article addresses the improvement of power processing technology through advanced inte- gration of power electronics. The goal of a subsystem in a module necessitates this advanced inte- gration. The central philosophy of the technology development research in the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Power Electronic Systems is to advance the state of the art by providing the concept of integrated power electronics modules (IPEMs). The technology underpinning such an IPEM approach is discussed. The fundamental functions in electronic power processing, the materials, processes and integration approaches and future concepts are explained. Ample use is made of illustrations, photographs of integrated modules and subsystems to en- hance the value of the article to the non-specialist},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to optimize direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generators for offshore direct drive wind turbines in order to reduce the cost of energy. A 6 MW wind turbine design is assumed and parametric electromagnetic and structural generator models are introduced for a surface-mounted magnet generator topology (using magnets with high BHmax) and a flux-concentrating variant (using magnets with lower BHmax). These are optimized using a hybrid genetic algorithm and pattern search process and the results show that the surface-mounted permanent magnet generator produces the lower cost of energy. The choice of objective function is addressed and it is found that a simplified metric incorporating generator cost and losses proxy produces similar designs to a full cost of energy calculation. Further steps to improve the quality of the model include the effect of generator mass on the design and cost of the turbine tower and foundation, which can add €0.4 m to the turbine cost. Further optimizations are carried out to show the impacts of magnetic material costs (doubling this leads to a €1.1/MWh increase in cost of energy) and generator diameter limits (increasing the upper limit from 6 to 8 m leads to a 0.9{\%} drop in cost of energy) have on the choice of optimum independent variables.},

This paper describes the thermal design of the motor to dissipate the losses from the drive, which were approximately a third of those from the motor. The power electronic components were mounted on the inside of a new end cover which was equipped with an extensive array of fins cooled by air from the external fan. The electronic components were insulated from the air in the end region of the motor. A heat sink plate was installed within the motor behind the end cover to conduct the heat from the motor that would otherwise have been dissipated through the end cover. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to model the ventilation and heat transfer from the new end cover and to develop improved fan geometries. It was concluded that CFD can be used effectively to design motor cooling systems. An improved fan geometry was designed to keep the power electronics cool under high ambient temperatures with the motor running at full load},

abstract = {This paper proposes a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system that is consisted of a boost converter with maximum power tracking, battery charge controller, inverter, and the related control circuits. A sliding mode controller is designed for controlling the boost converter to output the maximum power of the solar cells. A control strategy is proposed of a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) impendence adapter coupling a photovoltaic generator to a battery. The proposed strategy is based on the sliding mode control theory of continuing systems to permit a direct control of power converter. The PV generator price is even relatively high, so the user is interested of the optimal coupling of PV generator to electromechanical loads. In fact, this system uses the optimal coupling in order to have maximum power during the whole operating period. A grid-connected inverter is designed to transform the maximum output power into the load and utility. The real power control is using zero-cross and phase-lock circuits that control the inverter output voltage which is phase lead and synchronized with the utility. A digital circuit is used to detect the phase angles of the load voltage and current to control the inverter output amplitude to achieve the reactive power load compensation. A monitor circuit is designed to detect the voltage and frequency variation in the utility. When the photovoltaic system encounters a voltage and frequency deviation, the monitor circuit immediately disconnects the photovoltaic system from the utility to prevent the island effect. The proposed system is implemented by using OP amplifiers and micro controller (PIC16F877A). Both the simulation and experimental results using MATLAB show the sliding mode controller for maximum power tracking has good performance. The phase and amplitude control experiments achieve the real and reactive power control. The island effect experiments demonstrate evidence of the solar cell system protection ability illustrating the proposed grid-connected photovoltaic system has good operating performance.},

abstract = {Large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable energy (namely wind energy and solar PV) may entail new challenges in power systems and more volatility in power prices in liberalized electricity markets. Energy storage can diminish this imbalance, relieving the grid congestion, and promoting distributed generation. The economic implications of grid-scale electrical energy storage technologies are however obscure for the experts, power grid operators, regulators, and power producers. A meticulous technoeconomic or cost-benefit analysis of electricity storage systems requires consistent, updated cost data and a holistic cost analysis framework. To this end, this study critically examines the existing literature in the analysis of life cycle costs of utility-scale electricity storage systems, providing an updated database for the cost elements (capital costs, operational and maintenance costs, and replacement costs). Moreover, life cycle costs and levelized cost of electricity delivered by electrical energy storage is analyzed, employing Monte Carlo method to consider uncertainties. The examined energy storage technologies include pumped hydropower storage, compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheel, electrochemical batteries (e.g. lead-acid, NaS, Li-ion, and Ni-Cd), flow batteries (e.g. vanadium-redox), superconducting magnetic energy storage, supercapacitors, and hydrogen energy storage (power to gas technologies). The results illustrate the economy of different storage systems for three main applications: bulk energy storage, T{\&}D support services, and frequency regulation.},

abstract = {Advances in high-power-density batteries have rekindled interest in using inductive store as a pulse compression system. Although these batteries are considered very power dense, they lack over an order of magnitude of power density to drive a deployable electric gun. However, one can add an inductive circuit to a battery bank to make a hybrid system that has a much higher power density than batteries alone. A battery-inductor hybrid pulsed-power supply boasts several advantages over pulsed alternators, as inductors are static and relatively easy to cool. Inductors are potentially more energy dense than capacitors, making a battery-inductor hybrid pulsed-power supply an attractive alternative to capacitor-based pulsed-power supplies. The opening switch has been a major obstacle in previous inductive store projects, but in simulation, a new circuit topology-the Slow Transfer of Energy Through Capacitive Hybrid (STRETCH) meat grinder-greatly attenuates the problem.

These uncertainties are in addition to the greater uncertainty that TOs are facing compared to the era of vertically integrated utilities with coordinated transmission and generation planning. All of these factors impact the scope, timeline and cost of transmission expansion required to successfully interconnect and operate new wind generation customers. This paper reviews the challenges of wind interconnection from the TO's perspective and discusses the possibility of employing scalable power flow control solutions on the existing transmission system in order to minimize this uncertainty in all four dimensions while also reducing or eliminating transmission congestion on existing transmission lines. Scalable power flow control allows transmission utilities to interconnect new generation customers in a flexible manner, bring generation online sooner and allocate costs to customers incrementally. Further, it can provide a cost effective way to minimize congestion that can result in curtailing wind generators during critical load periods. Consequences of Transmission Constraints Utility-scale wind deployments in the US have increased rapidly over the last decade. Financial incentives, state and federal regulations, and climate change concerns continue to drive the construction of more renewable capacity, and the EPA's proposed clean power plan is adding an additional layer of uncertainty. Constraints on the transmission grid tend to be one of the main challenges to integrating utility scale wind generators. These constraints cause two main issues:  Certain constraints must be resolved before a wind generator can be brought online initially, increasing the fixed cost of wind deployment.  Constraints may cause congestion at certain times resulting in wind generators being curtailed (turned off) even when the wind is blowing, reducing generator revenue.  The cost and time to address some transmission constraints may derail certain generation projects altogether.},

abstract = {The PEGASUS facility houses one of the railguns of the French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis (ISL). With its 10 MJ distributed energy storage and a 6 m long launcher tube, projectiles with a mass of several hundred grams are accelerated to muzzle velocities greater than 2000 m/s. The fiber brush armatures are supported by a sabot made of glass-fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP), an orthotropic insulating material with the best mechanical performance found so far. If the muzzle velocity is intended to be substantially increased, the sabot material may reach its mechanical limits due to the high dynamic loading. Hence a precise understanding of the material behavior will be necessary, especially with regard to the failure mechanisms that occur. The mechanical behavior of the sabot is analyzed by means of numerical simulation combining two 3D-finite-element codes: the electromagnetic code MEGA and the mechanical dynamic code LS-DYNA3D. The Lorentz force computed by MEGA is introduced into LS-DYNA3D as a time-and space-dependent volumetric load inside the brushes. By calculating the stress-strain distribution of the sabot, the regions which are liable to fail can be identified. The simulation results are validated by comparison with the experimental work using the X-ray photographs taken at the muzzle of the launcher. {\textcopyright} 2004 IEEE.},

abstract = {Gallium–nitride power transistor (GaN HEMT) and integrated circuit technologies have matured dramatically over the last few years, and many hundreds of thousands of devices have been manufactured and fielded in applications ranging from pulsed radars and counter-IED jammers to CATV modules and fourth-generation infrastructure base-stations. GaN HEMT devices, exhibiting high power densities coupled with high breakdown voltages, have opened up the possibilities for highly efficient power amplifiers (PAs) exploiting the principles of waveform engineered designs. This paper summarizes the unique advantages of GaN HEMTs compared to other power transistor technologies, with examples of where such features have been exploited. Since RF power densities of GaN HEMTs are many times higher than other technologies, much attention has also been given to thermal management—examples of both commercial “off-the-shelf” packaging as well as custom heat-sinks are described. The very desirable feature of having accurate large-signal models for both discrete transistors and monolithic microwave integrated circuit foundry are emphasized with a number of circuit design examples. GaN HEMT technology has been a major enabler for both very broadband high-PAs and very high-efficiency designs. This paper describes examples of broadband amplifiers, as well as several of the main areas of high-efficiency amplifier design—notably Class-D, Class-E, Class-F, and Class-J approaches, Doherty PAs, envelope-tracking techniques, and Chireix outphasing.},

Themaximum theoretical efficiency is a parameter needed to calculate the EML's efficiency. Constant inductance gradient EMLs include the conventional railgun, the augmented railgun, and the conventional helical launcher. The maximum theoretical efficiency of an EML is dependent on its geometry and the manner, or mode, in which it is powered. In the lossless case, the conventional railgun, the augmented railgun, and the conven- tional helical launcher are capable of 50{\%} maximum efficiency when operating in constant current (CC) mode. Conventional and augmented railguns can achieve 100{\%} maximum efficiency when operating in zero exit-current mode.While zero exit-current mode promotes high efficiency, this mode can reduce EMLlifetime since it requires current levels much higher than those found in CC mode. The high-efficiency helical launcher, presented and ana- lyzed here for the first time, combines 100{\%} maximum theoretical efficiency with the low-current benefits of constant-current mode.},

A method is proposed to accurately extract the device package parasitic inductance, which is of vital importance to better predict the high-frequency switching performance of the device. The simulation model is verified by a double-pulse tester, and the results match well both in terms of device switching waveform and switching energy. Based on the simulation model, an investigation of the package influence on the cascode GaN HEMT is presented, and several critical parasitic inductances are identified and verified. Finally, a detailed loss breakdown is made for a buck converter, including a comparison between hard switching and soft switching. The results indicate that the switching loss is a dominant part of the total loss under hard-switching conditions in megahertz high-frequency range and below 8{\~{}}10 A operation current; therefore, soft switching is preferred to achieve high-frequency and high-efficiency operation of the high-voltage GaN HEMT.},

abstract = {Industrial applications of medium-voltage drives impose increasingly stringent performance requirements, particularly with regard to harmonic distortions of the phase currents of the controlled electrical machine. An established method to achieve very low current distortions during steady-state operation is to employ offline calculated optimized pulse patterns (OPP). Achieving high dynamic performance, however, proves to be very difficult in a system operated by OPPs. In this paper, we propose a method that combines the optimal steady-state performance of OPPs with the very fast dynamics of trajectory tracking control. A constrained optimal control problem with a receding horizon policy, i.e., model predictive control (MPC), is formulated and solved. Results show that the combination of MPC with OPPs satisfies both the strict steady-state as well as the dynamic performance requirements imposed by the most demanding industrial applications. The estimation of the fundamental components of the machine variables separately from their respective harmonic components is not required. As a result, complicated structures such as observers can be avoided, contrary to state-of-the-art methods. A further advantage of the MPC method is the use of a receding horizon policy, which provides feedback and a high degree of robustness.},

Besides the participation in voltage control, there also exists a growing interest in the delivering of other ancillary services like power-frequency control. This paper investigates further the technical feasibility of delivering frequency support with wind turbines in a small power system. Different control mechanisms are elaborated in Matlab/Simulink to deliver frequency support in the case where the turbines have a power reserve available and in the case where they are operating at maximum available power. Also the influence of the generation mix is examined. Results reveal that the displacement of conventional generation with wind power results in a deterioration of the frequency response. However, due to the implementation of the different control mechanisms presented in this paper for delivering inertial response and primary control, the frequency stability is improved.},

abstract = { Arcing transition of metal-to-metal contacts is a key technical challenge in the development of railgun launchers.  Theoretical understanding of the process remains poor and controversial. Several authors have explained transitioning by a velocity skin effect driven "melt wave" Others have shown experimentally, that arcing transition even occurs for static contacts subject to high current pulses, and have proposed a "contact resistance" model, with the contact resistance due to A-spots. This model explained the available experimental data reasonably well for armatures with relatively short lengths of the contact zone. The velocity skin effect model assumes a perfect, resistance free contact, while the contact resistance model neglects any velocity related effects. In this paper we combine the two approaches to obtain a more realistic picture of the velocity skin effect and its role in transitioning of armature contacts. We show that when realistic properties of the contact interface are taken into account, the structure of the velocity skin effect and the speed of a wave of local transitioning may significantly differ from the "ideal" theory.},

abstract = {Current loop transfer function of a single-phase grid-tie inverter has been systematically derived with representations of conventional transfer function format using admittance terms for controller design and loop compensation. The power circuit adopts the LCL type filter to allow universal output that can be operated in both standalone and grid-tie modes. The proposed admittance compensation along with a quasi-proportional-resonant controller is designed to achieve high gain at the fundamental frequency while maintaining enough stability margins. The entire current loop controller and admittance compensation have been simulated and tested with a 5-kW fuel cell prototype. Without the admittance path compensation, simulation results indicate that the system cannot start up smoothly and the zero current command cannot be tracked very well. At first simulation cycle, the power flow erratically fed back to the inverter that may cause catastrophe failure. With admittance path compensation, the time-domain current steady-state error can be easily reduced with the loop gain design in frequency-domain. Simulation and experimental results show that the inverter is capable of both standalone and grid-tie connection mode operations and smooth power flow control even with zero current command.},

High fault-tolerant and low toque ripple features are achieved by employing fractional slot concentrated windings (FSCWs) and open windings. Excessive magnetomotive force (MMF) harmonic components can lead to thermal demagnetization of rotor magnets as well as high core loss. An improved all-teeth-wound winding disposition that changes the winding factor of each harmonic is applied to suppress harmonics. A relatively large slot leakage inductance that limits the short-circuit current (SCC) induced in the short-circuited winding is proposed to deal with short-circuit fault. Fault-tolerant controls up to two phases open circuited are investigated in this paper based on keeping the same torque-producing MMF. The fault-tolerant control strategies corresponding to each faulty mode are studied and compared to ensure high performance operation.},

Recent work suggests magnetic blowoff forces arising from perimeter erosion as a possible significant mechanism. Three-dimensional finite-element (FE) models were constructed to analyze the repulsive contact forces resulting from perimeter erosion. Results show that magnetic blowoff occurs only when there is a loss of more than 98{\%} of the contact area. Such gross perimeter erosion is unlikely and is not found in recovered armatures. Magnetic liftoff from perimeter erosion does not appear to be a causative mechanism in armature transition. This computational study also provided a platform for testing two FE codes, which showed very good agreement overall},

abstract = {For a grid-connected converter with an LCL filter, the harmonic compensators of a proportional-resonant (PR) controller are usually limited to several low-order current harmonics due to system instability when the compensated frequency is out of the bandwidth of the system control loop. In this paper, a new current feedback method for PR current control is proposed. The weighted average value of the currents flowing through the two inductors of the LCL filter is used as the feedback to the current PR regulator. Consequently, the control system with the LCL filter is degraded from a third-order function to a first-order one. A large proportional control-loop gain can be chosen to obtain a wide control-loop bandwidth, and the system can be optimized easily for minimum current harmonic distortions, as well as system stability. The inverter system with the proposed controller is investigated and compared with those using traditional control methods. Experimental results on a 5-kW fuel-cell inverter are provided, and the new current control strategy has been verified.},

method using a full adaptive permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM)
observer in a d/q reference frame. It appears that the fault sensitivity
of PMSM stator currents and rotor speed measurements is very low with
regard to single mechanical faults. That is why an amplification of
single mechanical fault signatures in frequency domain is proposed by
adjusting the adaptive PMSM observer gains. To study the influence of
the adaptive PMSM observer gains on fault signatures, the observer model
is first of all linearized at an operating point. Then, the static gain,
the resonance, and the quality factor Q of different transfer functions
are analyzed. A dedicated experimental setup based on an original
mechanical fault emulator and a 7.8 kW PMSM drive is designed to
validate the simulation results. The simulation and the experimental

Seven configurations are chosen for the comparison, consisting of both radial-flux and axial-flux machines. The comparison is done at seven power levels ranging from 1 to 200 kW. The basis for the comparison is discussed and implemented in detail in the design procedure. The criteria used for comparison are considered to be critical for the efficient deployment of PM wind generators.

Explicit formulas are given in the case of one- and two-layer FSCWs with a number of phases ranging from 3 to 7. The obtained analytical expressions are validated by a finite-element analysis, showing excellent agreement between both calculation methods, even for large slot-opening-to-slot-pitch ratios.

abstract = {This paper presents a digital optimal battery charger that has an inherent characteristics of detecting the fault (main switch failure, i.e., TOP FET failure of the converter) within one switching cycle. The charger consists of synchronous buck converter and a novel carrier generation (synthetic ripple) based digital feedback clamped hysteretic modulator. The proposed charger charges the battery with the constant current for less battery state of charge (SOC) and charges it with the constant voltage when the battery SOC reaches near 100{\%}. The charger facilitates smooth and stable transition from constant current (CC) mode to constant voltage (CV) mode without the need of extra switch or control loop. The novel feedback clamped digital hysteretic modulator used in the charger generates carrier to the hysteretic comparator in the field programmable gate array (FPGA) based digital domain by generating piece-wise linear synthetic ripple using sensed converter voltages (switch node voltage and the output voltage), without the need of direct inductor current sensing and adding the output voltage to it. The regulation loop is clamped and hence the charger remains in the feedback controlled during the whole charging cycle. Experimental and simulation results verify the operation of the proposed charging system on 20 W prototype. The performance of the charger is verified on a 6 V-4.5 Ah lead acid battery as well.},

abstract = { In this paper a description and operating principles of a consequent-pole permanent-magnet machine are presented. In addition, a sizing analysis, finite-element analysis, and experimental results for a prototype machine are addressed. Due to its particular configuration, this machine allows for a wide range of control of the air-gap flux with minimum field ampere-turn requirements and without brushes or slip rings. Two components of the field flux are produced. One, which is almost constant, is produced by the permanent magnet located on the rotor surface. The other, which is variable, is produced by a field winding positioned circumferentially in the center of the stator. These two flux components converge in the air gap. The excitation level of the machine is manipulated by controlling the DC field current. Three-dimensional finite-element analysis and experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to vary the flux over a wide range to keep the terminal voltage constant as the speed increases. A 3 kW 1000-3000 r/min eight-pole and 32 VAC generator using this configuration is tested to verify the flux control capability of this structure.},

This can be very helpful in the critical few seconds following a load-generation mismatch. Through time-domain simulations, performance of the proposed controller is examined against earlier implementations of inertial response. Results show that the proposed controller is effective in arresting the initial frequency dip and capable of bringing together the advantages of earlier implementations for better integration of wind generators.},

Aerospace applications involve essentially safety-critical systems which should be able to overcome hardware or software faults and therefore need to be fault tolerant. A way of achieving this is to introduce variable degrees of redundancy into the system by duplicating one or all of the operations within the system itself. Looking at motor drives, multiphase machines, such as multiphase brushless dc machines, are considered to be good candidates in the design of fault-tolerant aerospace motor drives. This paper introduces a multiphase two-level inverter using a flexible and reliable field-programmable gate-array/digital-signal-processor controller for data acquisition, motor control, and fault monitoring to study the fault tolerance of such systems.},

The growing pressure, primarily driven by environmental concerns, for generating more electricity from renewables and improving energy efficiency have promoted the application of DER into electricity systems. So far, DER have been used to displace energy from conventional generating plants but not to displace their capacity as they are not visible to system operators. If this continues, this will lead to problematic over-capacity issues and under- utilisation of the assets, reduce overall system efficiency and eventually increase the electricity cost that needs to be paid by society. The concept of VPP was developed to enhance the visibility and control of DER to system operators and other market actors by providing an appropriate interface between these system components. The technical and commercial functionality facilitated through the VPP are described and concludes with case studies demonstrating the benefit of aggregation (VPP concept) and the use of the optimal power flow algorithm to characterise VPP.},

deck guns. Therefore, one of the most promising scenarios for the future
application of rail guns in naval warfare is the long range artillery.
Hypervelocity projectiles being propelled to velocities above 2 km/s
reach targets at the distances of 200 km or more. At the French-German
Research Institute, the PEGASUS launcher is used for investigations with
respect to this scenario. The 6-m-long barrel has a square caliber of 40
mm. The power supply unit is able to deliver 10 MJ to the gun. Within
this investigation, a complete launch package is being developed and
experiments are performed that aim at showing that this package can be
accelerated to velocities ranging from 2000 to 2500 m/s. A launch
package consists out of an armature, a sabot, and the projectile. The
armature ensures the electrical contact during launch and pushes the
sabot with its payload through the barrel. The sabot guides and protects
the payload during the acceleration. At the same time, the accelerating
forces generated at the armature need to be transferred to the
projectile. After the launch package has left the barrel, the sabot
should open and release its payload, the projectile into free-flight.
Here, the current status of the launch package development and results
from Experiments with the PEGASUS rail gun is presented.},

abstract = {Voltage-oriented PI control of three-phase grid-connected pulsewidth-modulation rectifiers with LCL filters is addressed. LCL filters require resonance damping. Active resonance damping is state of the art to face the problem, but it is still under investigation because of the manifold solutions. It is often realized using many sensors and/or complex control algorithms. In contrast, pure PI control requires only one set of current sensors, and its implementation and design are rather simple and well known from the L filter control. PI control has already been shown to be a suitable solution also for LCL filters, but there are limitations. These are investigated in this paper. System stability is analyzed with respect to different ratios of LCL filter resonance and control frequencies. The latter are important parameters for system design and control. Both line and converter current control are analyzed. For a certain range of frequency ratios, the voltage-oriented PI control gives stable performance without additional feedback, but for ratios outside this range, stable operation is impossible. Experimental tests validate the theoretical results. In addition, an experimentally determined LCL filter transfer function is shown in this paper, which shows a lower resonance peak as expected from commonly used filter models.},

As the renewable energy sector grows, the need for engineers qualified to design such systems grows as well. In order to train such engineers, new courses are needed that highlight the unique engineering challenges presented by renewable energy systems. This paper presents the theory, implementation, and assessment of a new laboratory course designed to teach power electronics and renewable energy to engineering students. A key element of the course is the use of real renewable energy systems in the laboratory setting. Students design, test, and troubleshoot power electronic circuits (such as dc/dc converters and pulse-width-modulated inverters) with tools used widely in industry (such as MATLAB/Simulink and dSPACE digital signal processors).

abstract = {Railgun solid armature materials are exposed to intense joule heating
and high strain conditions.  Limited mechanical property data are
available for armature materials under these conditions.  Mechanical
strength-at-temperature data described in handbooks do not adequately
describe material strength under pulsed current conditions.
This paper describes a technique for generating tensile strength versus
electrical action curves for armature materials under pulsed current
conditions.  This technique is capable of imposing high strain rates ( {\textgreater}
10(3) sec-1) under pulse current conditions by electromagnetically
expanding a wire formed from a candidate armature material.  The strain
rate is derived by determining the change in mutual inductance between
the expanding test wire and a fixed reference wire.
The paper describes the experimental technique and discusses results
obtained for aluminum and copper armature materials.  The results
indicate that aluminum and copper armature materials maintain a high
percentage of room temperature tensile strength under actual railgun

The main objective is to surpass the results obtained previously with glass-fiber-reinforced epoxy composites. Due to higher ductility and superior dynamic behavior of PEEK polymers, an S2-glass woven fabric preimpregnated with a PEEK resin was selected. The interlaminar resistance and tensile behavior of the material was characterized experimentally. The results led to the identification of the most suitable fiber/resin ratio and fabrication process for thick laminates. Several prototypes weighing about 320 g were produced and used for six shots with the PEGASUS railgun. Already in the first series of experiments, the laminates show a remarkable mechanical resistance, and a maximal velocity of 2440 m/s was obtained.},

abstract = {In order to maximize the energy harnessed, to minimize the cost, to improve the power quality and to ensure safety together with the growth of the size, various wind turbine concepts have been developed during last three decades. Different generator systems such as geared and direct-drive generator systems have been developed. Based on energy yield, reliability and maintenance problems, direct-drive generator systems have been regarded as a better concept than geared generator systems. Among different generator types, the permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) is superior in overall efficiency. The PMSG has also been discussed as a concept with higher force density than the electrically excited (EE) generators. PMSG can thus be small and lightweight compared to induction generators and direct-drive electrically excited synchronous generators (EESG DD). Therefore, this thesis focuses on the research of the direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator system (PMSG DD) for large wind turbines. The main objective of the thesis is to find a design solution for large direct-drive wind generators with highest possible energy yield and lowest possible cost. In order to achieve the objective, the following issues are covered in the thesis.},

abstract = {The increasing installation of photovoltaic panels in low-voltage grids causes an over voltage problem, especially during high production and low consumption periods. Generally the over voltage problem is overcome by implementing reactive power control methods. The advances in networked control systems theory and practice create new scenarios where reactive power control methods can offer additional features and benefits. To explore these new capabilities, this study presents two new reactive power control methods that exploit the networked approach. These two methods are evaluated in a comparative reference framework that also includes the base-line case where no reactive control method is applied, the conventional droop method approach, and a solution based on a near-optimal location of a high power STATCOM derived from one of the new proposed networked methods. The main merit factors used to compare the control methods are the maximum voltage across the distribution grid, the power factor in the point of common coupling, and the total power losses and economic cost of the installation. With these merit factors, the advantages and limitations of the new and existing control methods are revealed and discussed. A useful discussion for selecting the best control solution is also reported.},

abstract = {Electrical conduction through anisotropically conductive adhesive (ACA) is caused by deformation of metal fillers under pressure and heat. In this work, the hardness of the electrical particles under various deformation degrees was determined by nano-indentor measurements and the electrical resistance of the electrical contacts was measured under various deformation degrees. Theoretical model and simulation have been developed for the microscopic mechanism of the electrical conduction through metal fillers in the anisotropically conductive adhesive. By comparing with experimental data it is concluded that the deformation of the metal filler in our ACA is plastic even at rather low external load. Further theoretical simulation reveals two important aspects of the conductance characteristics. The conductance is improved by increasing the external load but the dependence of the conductance on the spatial position of the metal filler becomes stronger. Design and optimization of the ACA with respect to the absolute value of the electric conductance and its dependence on the spatial position of the metal filler are of essential importance for the electronics packaging application of the anisotropically conductive adhesives.

A novel model predictive control scheme is proposed that keeps the motor torque, the stator flux, and (if present) the inverter's neutral point potential within given hysteresis bounds while minimizing the switching frequency of the inverter. Based on an internal model of the drive, the controller predicts several future switch transitions, extrapolates the output trajectories, and chooses the sequence of inverter switch positions (voltage vectors) that minimizes the switching frequency. The advantages of the proposed controller are twofold. First, as underlined by the experimental results in the second part of this paper, it yields a superior performance with respect to the industrial state of the art. Specifically, the switching frequency is reduced by up to 50{\%} while the torque and flux are kept more accurately within their bounds. Moreover, the fast dynamic torque response is inherited from standard DTC. Second, the scheme is applicable to a large class of (three-phase) AC electric machines driven by inverters.},

abstract = {Renewed interest has arisen in plasma armatures as evidenced by two papers presented at the 2008 EML Symposium. It is hoped that the work at the University of Texas described in these papers succeeds. There may, however, be some uncertainties related to the nature of plasma armatures in that work. The thoughts we offer here may help. It is not yet obvious how the 6-km/s velocity limit encountered in the Canberra railgun can be overcome. In the years following this discovery, a considerable number of experiments were conducted on the subject with no clear outcome. One strategy for overcoming the velocity limit may be to vent the bore behind the armature. In order to do this, it is necessary to find out how long the armature must be to be effective. Too long would make the venting process unwieldy. Too short and the armature losses will rise to unacceptable levels. Further, the method we suggest for implementing the venting strategy may be extended to prevent damage to the railgun rails caused by the arcing current transfer from rails to armature. We examine the possibilities and implications involved in implementing these strategies.},

abstract = {This paper presents a robust current control scheme for inductor-capacitor-inductor (LCL)-filtered distributed generation (DG) inverters featuring effective suppression of low- and high-frequency instabilities and grid-induced distortion and disturbances. The conceptual design of the proposed control scheme is to maximize the disturbance rejection performance against grid disturbances and parametric uncertainties, and minimize the coupling among active damping, disturbance rejection, and tracking controllers. First, a simple and robust active damping controller is realized by drooping the inverter control voltage with the capacitor current. Second, the augmented damped dynamics is used to design a robust controller, which is composed of a tracking controller, dynamic grid-disturbance rejection controller, and uncertainty rejection controller. The tracking controller is designed to yield deadbeat control performance to maximize the dynamic performance of the converter. The grid-disturbance rejection controller is designed to provide a base-line of grid-induced dynamics within the closed-loop system as an internal model; therefore, effective mitigation of grid-induced distortion can be achieved without a priori knowledge of the frequency modes to be eliminated. The uncertainty rejection controller is designed to reject voltage disturbances associated with parameter variation and imperfect compensation of the grid-disturbance-rejection controller. Theoretical analysis and comparative test results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

abstract = {The direct torque control approach called model predictive direct torque control (MP-DTC) is extended to field-weakening operation in this research. The controller is of the finite control set (FCS) type, which takes the discrete states of the voltage source inverter (VSI) into account. Each sampling period, the future behavior of the plant is predicted and inputs (voltage vectors) are selected using an optimization criterion, i.e., a cost function. Optimization, however, depend on the operation region. Maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) tracking for high electrical efficiency is aimed below rated speed, operation off the MTPA trajectory is necessary for obtaining field-weakening. In this work, a cost function is designed, which is suitable for operation at high speeds without penalizing operation below rated speed. MP-DTC is applied to permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drive systems. High control performances, i.e., dynamics, is obtained without increasing the switching frequency nor reducing significantly the torque quality. This feature is interesting above all for high power applications. The proposed control strategy has been evaluated on a small-scale (PMSM) drive system with two-level VSI for demonstration showing promising results.},

The C-GEN is prior to conventional PM generators by absence of magnetic attraction forces between rotor and stator, absence of cogging torque, ease of manufacturing, modularity and high fault-toleration [1]. Firstly, the integrated analytical design tool that couples electromagnetic, structural and thermal aspects of the generator has been introduced. Then, an optimization tool based on genetic algorithm has been used to maximize the annual electricity generation and to minimize the initial cost of the generator. The optimized generator is validated using FEA tools and the specifications of the generator has been presented.},

@article{Blaabjerg,
abstract = {– The steady growth of installed wind power which reached 200 GW capacity in 2010, together with the up-scaling of the single wind turbine power capability -7 MW's has been announced by manufacturers -has pushed the research and development of power converters towards full scale power conversion, lowered cost pr kW, and increased power density and the need for higher reliability. Substantial efforts are made to comply with the more stringent grid codes, especially grid faults ride-through and reactive power injection, which challenges power converter topologies, because the need for crowbar protection and/or power converter over-rating has been seen in the case of a doubly-fed induction generator. In this paper, power converter technologies are reviewed with focus on single/multi-cell power converter topologies. Further, case studies on the Low Voltage Ride Through demand to power converter technology are presented including a discussion on reliability. It is concluded that as the power level increases in wind turbines, medium voltage power converters will be a dominant power converter configuration.},

Furthermore, by comparing with a current shunt to measure a GaN-HEMT switching current, it is shown that CSP is able to measure a switching current of a few nanoseconds, while it brings no influence on transistor voltage waveform measurement. The obtained results show that the use of CSP brings little parasitic inductances in the measurement circuit and it does not bring the connection of the ground to the power converter.},

A comprehensive design tool with a holistic design approach is critical to maximise the overall system power density, e.g by identifying the optimal switching frequency. This paper presents a system level design tool that optimises the power density (volume or mass) of a 3-phase, 2-level DC-AC converter. The design tool optimises the selection of the devices, heatsink and passive components (including the design of the line, EMI and DC-link filters) to maximise the power density. The structure of the optimisation algorithm has been organised to reduce the number of potential design combinations by over 99{\%}, and thus produces fast simulation times. The design tool predicts that when SiC devices are used instead of Si ones, the power density is increased by 159.4{\%}. A 5 kW, 600 V DC-link, 3-phase, 2- level DC-AC converter was experimentally evaluated in order to confirm the accuracy of the design tool.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a design method for stepped skewing of rotor magnets to selectively eliminate the harmonics of the no-load electromotive force (EMF) and the ripple torque, which is generated by the interaction of the stator cur-rent magnetomotive force with the rotor magnet flux distribution. The method is based on the theory that a harmonic component of the ripple torque is generated by the corresponding two harmonics of the no-load EMF. An elementary unit of the proposed skewing for canceling out one harmonic EMF consists of two identical magnet blocks skewed axially. For suppressing a harmonic ripple torque, the corresponding two harmonic EMFs are canceled out by skewing two identical elementary units or a four-step skewing. In the paper, the skew angle for canceling out each harmonic EMF is theoretically obtained. It is shown that one harmonic ripple torque is almost completely suppressed by the proposed four-step skewing through two-dimensional and three-dimensional finite element method (FEM) analyses. In addition, experiments are performed to confirm the selective elimination of one harmonic EMF and to validate the FEM analyses. By using the proposed method, a multiple-step skewing can be designed to simultaneously suppress more than one harmonic component of the ripple torque.},

Based on the operation principle of the motor, the control strategy and scheme are developed and implemented experimentally.

abstract = {-This paper designed the gate driver circuits and optimized the PCB layout in a 7.2kW battery charger using paralleled GaN HEMTs. 650V/60A enhancement mode GaN HEMTs provided by GaN Systems Inc are adopted. To optimize the switching performance of paralleled GaN HEMTs with low loss and high reliability, effects of parasitic inductance and capacitance are modeled and analyzed. Through cancelling the flux in the commutation loop, the power-loop parasitic inductance is reduced to only 0.7nH, which significantly decreases the electrical stress in the switch turn-off process. A diverse-parameter gate driver design has been proposed to achieve the reliable switching off. The Finite-Element-Analysis and Spice simulation show our current design could effectively suppress the voltage overshoot and gate-drive ringing on HEMTs. Experiments were carried out on both double pulse test platform and the 7.2kW charger to verify the proposed design strategy.},

abstract = {The overall efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) systems connected to the grid depends on the efficiency of direct current (DC) of the solar modules to alternate current (AC) inverter conversion. The requirements for inverter connection include: maximum power point, high efficiency, control power injected into the grid, high power factor and low total harmonic distortion of the currents injected into the grid. An approach to power factor control and reactive power regulation for PV systems connected to the grid using field programmable gate array (FPGA) is proposed. According to the grid demands; both the injected active and reactive powers are controlled. In this paper, a new digital control strategy for a single-phase inverter is carried out. This control strategy is based on the phase shift between the inverter output voltage and the grid voltage, and the digital sinusoidal pulse width modulation (DSPWM) patterns, in order to control the power factor for a wide range of the inverter output current and consequently the control and the regulation of the reactive power will be achieved. The advantage of the proposed control strategy is its implementation around simple digital circuits. In this work, a simulation study of this strategy has been realized using Matlab/Simulink and PSIM. In order to validate its performance, this control has been implemented in a FPGA. Experimental tests have been carried out demonstrating the viability of this control in order to control the power factor and the injected power into the grid. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis (ISL) has a long tradition in experimental research on the topic of electromagnetic acceleration using railguns. The main focus of this research is on the military application of these potent accelerators. At the ISL several railguns with different calibers are routinely used in experiments. The most powerful of these is the 10-MJ PEGASUS railgun. This railgun is a 6 m long accelerator with a square caliber of 40mm. It is making use of a distributed power supply (DES) scheme, connecting 200 capacitor modules to the gun. These modules are equipped with semiconducting switches and a current of up to 2 MA is delivered to the first 4 m of the barrel length. Since several years this launcher is employed in a study, accelerating newly designed payload projectiles. At the same time, the primary energy being used during the experiments is increased, with the final goal to fully utilize the installed 10 MJ. In the experiments being reported here, a major shift in the projectile design took place. For many years, industrial glass-fiber reinforced plastic (GRP) for the projectile body and metal-fiber brushes for the current conduction were used. Due to mechanical problems (delamination) during acceleration of the GRP projectile body to velocities above 2 km/s, parts of the body were replaced by aluminum. This changed not only the mechanical, but also the electrical behavior of the projectile during launch. Here results and experiences made with separating payload projectiles being equipped with an aluminum “booster” are reported. With an energy of 5MJ, velocities above 2 km/s were reached.},

Moreover, the loss behavior of the two motors is rather different in the various operating ranges with the SPM one better at low speed due to short end connections but penalized at high speed by the need of a significant deexcitation current.

abstract = {— The medium power rating two-level three phase voltage source inverter is among the most popular power conversion systems. The typical switching frequency of the commercial medium power rating inverter, however, is limited to tens of kHz. By increasing the switching frequency and using emerging gallium-nitride devices, the size of the overall system can be greatly reduced. This paper begins by reviewing all commercially available GaN power transistors and their package technologies. The GS66516T device from GaN Systems is selected due to its suitable ratings and superior package performance. Then, a half-bridge structure is designed for this device to achieve low parasitic inductance and strong cooling capability at the same time. The dynamic characterization results of this 650V/60A Enhancement-mode GaN transistor are extracted with the proposed half-bridge structure. A gate drive circuit with comprehensive protection function is integrated. Based on the proposed phase-leg structure, a 10 kW three phase inverter prototype is built and the experimental waveform is shown at the end.},

abstract = {Smart grids are often analyzed using a top-down approach, i.e., starting from communication and control technologies evolution, to then focus on their effects on active and passive users, in terms of new services, higher efficiency and quality of supply. However, with their bottom-up approach, virtual power plants (VPP) are very promising instruments for promoting an effective integration of distributed generation (DG) and energy storage devices as well as valid means for enabling consumers to respond to load management signals, when operated under the supervision of a scheduling coordinator. These aggregation factors can be very profitable for the distributed energy resources (DERs) economy and for the energy network itself. This paper presents a new algorithm to optimize the day-ahead thermal and electrical scheduling of a large scale VPP (LSVPP) which contains: a) many small-scale producers and consumers (“prosumers”) distributed over a large territory and b) energy storage and cogeneration processes. The algorithm also takes into account the actual location of each DER in the public network and their specific capability. Thermal and electrical generator models, load and storage devices are very detailed and flexible, as are the rates and incentives framework. Several novelties, with respect to the previous literature, are proposed. Case study results are also described and discussed},

generated some controversy because many previous investigations of
armature behavior had obtained good agreement between theory and

The fault detection is realized based on a Residual Current Vector (RCV) generated by the difference between the measured stator currents and the stator currents estimated by a state observer. In order to avoid false alarms due to possible undesired perturbations, the sequence decomposition of the RCV is performed by employing different referenceframes. Thus, the proposed RCV allows the correct detection of interturn short-circuit faults and quantification of the fault severity in any faulty stator-phase winding. Moreover, since the Back-EMF generated by the magnets is proportional to the rotor shaft speed, the electrical angular speed is estimated through the stator voltages measurement, without using a speed sensor. Simulation results from the three-phase PMSM dynamic model that allows considering the interturn short-circuit fault in any stator phase-windings are presented. The proposed method is validated using a three-phase PMSM prototype with modified stator windings. The robustness and the reliability of the proposal was tested for several interturn fault conditions under transient conditions including different disturbances.},

abstract = {This paper explores the use of GaN power FETs to realize an integrated modular motor drive (IMMD) with an induction motor. A structure in which inverter modules are connected in series is proposed to reduce the module maximum voltages and to offer an opportunity to utilize low-voltage wide-band-gap GaN devices. With the superb switching performance of GaN power FETs, a reduction in IMMD size is achieved by eliminating inverter heat sink and optimizing dc-link capacitors. Gate signals of the IMMD modules are interleaved to suppress the total voltage ripple of dc-link capacitors and to further reduce the capacitor size. Motor winding configurations and their coupling effect are also investigated as a part of the IMMD design. The proposed structure and design methods are verified by experimental results.},

abstract = {In order to improve the efficiency of wind power generation system (WPGS), many researchers have tried to develop a larger WPGS and a superconducting synchronous generator (SCSG) has been suggested to develop over 5 MW class WPGS. There are two expected types of drive-train, geared and gearless. The structure and electrical parameters of the SCSG depend on the type of drive-train used. This paper deals with a comparative analysis of the 10 MW class geared and gearless types of the SCSG for WPGS. Three drive-trains are designed for the 10 MW class SCSGs using the finite elements method analysis tool. The PSCAD/EMTDC is utilized to simulate electrical and dynamic behaviors of the modeled SCSGs. The simulation results show the operation characteristics of the designed SCSGs and suggest that the single-stage gearbox type drive-train is the most efficient drive-train for the SCSG due to the reduction of the number of rotor poles and the volume of the generator, even though the geared-type drive-train requires periodical maintenance. {\textcopyright} 2002-2011 IEEE.},

Instead of utilizing two adjacent active vectors at each switching period as in classic PWM strategies, this new strategy utilizes two nonadjacent active vectors in the case of low-modulation index or three consecutive active vectors in the case of high-modulation index. Analytical calculations show that this new strategy is particularly effective in terms of reducing filtering capacitor rms current for high-power factor compared to space vector PWM which is used as a reference strategy. The impact of this strategy on output current quality is also investigated.},

abstract = {Power converters are complex devices subject to failures that can lead to undesired stops. For this reason, many fault-tolerant topologies and strategies have been deeply studied, mainly focusing on improving the electromechanical behavior of the reconfigured drive after the fault. However, it is also very important to evaluate the possible increase of power losses. In this paper, a power loss analysis is performed on a current-controlled three-phase inverter supplying a permanent-magnet synchronous motor (just chosen as an example), for all the operating modes, starting from the fault occurrence until the faulty operation mode is established. This is particularly important because the effectiveness of a fault-tolerant control strategy depends on the possibility to maintain a continuous operation. The latter is ensured only if there is no such increment of the losses that the survival of the component is at risk. The simulations are validated by means of experimental tests, and the results are discussed. The method can be easily applied to other topologies and reconfiguration strategies.},

The MPDTC scheme is designed to keep the motor torque and stator flux and the inverter's neutral point potential within given hysteresis bounds while reducing the average switching frequency of the inverter, in comparison with the standard direct torque control (DTC) method. The algorithm is embedded in the control software environment of ABB's ACS6000 medium-voltage drive, and experimental results are provided which verify the advantageous features of MPDTC in terms of average inverter switching frequency reduction. More specifically, compared to standard DTC, the proposed MPDTC scheme achieves an average (over the whole operating range) reduction of the inverter switching frequency of 16.5{\%}, but for specific operating conditions the reduction is as much as 37.4{\%}.},

@article{Li1997,
abstract = {An electrical conduction model for silver filled isotropically conductive adhesives (ICA) was developed. The model combines the microscopic resistance of the bulk silver particles and the contact between silver flakes with the macroscale resistor network calculation by percolation theory. The resistivities of the composites were calculated by resistor network simulations considering both contact effects and particle size effects. Three different types of film typically exist on the silver surface: residual organic films; tarnish films; and a thin epoxy layer. The contact resistance between silver flakes can be due to a constriction resistance, to the tunneling resistance through insulating films, or to the resistance of more conductive layers. The constriction resistance is produced by the restriction of the current flow by small contact spots and is controlled by the actual contact spot area (metallic contact), which is dependent on the contact force between flakes. The tunneling resistance is caused by the very thin layer which may reside on the silver flakes between the metallic contact spots, and is dependent on a barrier film thickness and potential. Oxide and sulfide tarnish films are typically degenerate semiconductors. Two- and three-dimensional (2-D and 3-D) computer simulations were performed to predict the effects of particle sizes, shapes, and distribution on the percolation conduction thresholds and cluster sizes. The model predicts that the percolation threshold decreases with broad particle size distributions and high aspect ratio particles. The effective resistivity of the adhesive depends on the thickness dimension of the adhesive pad geometry, with very thin layers resulting in high percolation thresholds and high resistivities. Resistivity does not change with the pad thicknesses greater than a certain thickness level. Silver flake orientation on the surface increases the resistivity of the conductive adhesive pads, but in the same magnitude range. The resistivities of the materials are controlled by silver flake sizes and the nature of the contacts},

abstract = {As the development and installation of photovoltaic (PV) systems are still growing at an exceptionally rapid pace, relevant grid integration policies are going to change consequently in order to accept more PV systems in the grid. The next generation PV systems will play an even more active role like what the conventional power plants do today in the grid regulation participation. Requirements of ancillary services like Low-Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) associated with reactive current injection and voltage support through reactive power control, have been in effectiveness in some countries. Those advanced features can be provided by next-generation PV systems, and will be enhanced in the future to ensure an even efficient and reliable utilization of PV systems. In the light of this, Reactive Power Injection (RPI) strategies for single-phase PV systems are explored in this paper. The RPI possibilities are: a) constant average active power control, b) constant active current control, c) constant peak current control and d) thermal optimized control strategy. All those strategies comply with the currently active grid codes, but are with different objectives. The thermal optimized control strategy is demonstrated on a 3 kW single-phase PV system by simulations. The other three RPI strategies are verified experimentally on a 1 kW singe-phase system in LVRT operation mode. Those results show the effectiveness and feasibilities of the proposed strategies with reactive power control during LVRT operation. The design and implementation considerations for the characterized strategies are also discussed.},

electromagnetic launchers. The reason is that the machine can offer high
voltage and current performance in a single-element energy storage
device, a smooth pulse profile, and naturally cycled current zeros,
which can allow for extremely low muzzle currents and simplifies
switching requirements. But because of the short history of the air-core
pulsed alternator in China, the relevant theoretical research is not
enough and the experience in fabrication is absent. It is really
necessary to summarize a preliminary design method in order to rapidly
determine the size and approximately evaluate the electrical performance
of the machine. The optimization will be based on this first-stage
design scheme. In this paper, based on the requirements of the railgun,
some important design considerations of a seven-phase and six-pole
air-core pulsed alternator are presented in detail. In addition, it is
significant to obtain the analytical formulas for the first-stage design
requiring less costs; these formulas intuitively allow us to expedite
the design process and optimize the design scheme. Finally, some basic
output parameters of the machine are given for the preliminary design;
the designed pulsed alternator will generate 1.4 kV and drive a train of
1-MA pulses into a 5-m railgun, accelerating 200-g masses at 2 km/s.},

abstract = {The design and experimental results of a 40-stage distributed energy store (DES) plasma arc railgun are presented. The railgun drives a free running hypervelocity plasma arc, one that is not pushing a payload, to velocities in excess of 10 km/s. These high velocities are of interest as they are required to successfully launch payloads into low earth orbit (LEO). The ability to launch payloads into LEO using a hypervelocity electromagnetic launcher has many financial benefits over the more conventional chemical combustion launchers. In collaboration with an Air Force Office of Scientific Research funded Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative project, the Center for Pulsed Power and Power Electronics at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas has been responsible for developing and investigating a functional scale model of a multistage DES railgun to determine its effectiveness to suppress restrike phenomenon and increase plasma armature railgun performance. The distributed energy scheme is theorized to suppress restrike arc formation because the back emf voltage is localized to active stage regions where high gas density and low temperature inhibits breakdown. B-dot sensors positioned along the length of the launcher provide data to measure the plasma arc velocity and detect restrike, arc splitting, or additional secondary arc formation phenomena.},

abstract = {Iron losses in permanent-magnet synchronous machines form a larger portion of the total losses than in induction machines and, hence, more importance should be given to the iron losses. Previously, models have been presented for the calculations of these losses, but these models still rely on finite-element simulations to obtain correction factors, which are substantial, to apply to the theoretically derived formulas in order to obtain good agreement with the experimental data. This paper points out the source of this correction factor: the neglect of the excess eddy-current loss component. In many cases, this loss component dominates the total iron losses and needs to be incorporated in the theoretical considerations. The paper also provides a more complete model of iron loss, which greatly reduces the need for calculating the correction factors using the finite-element method (FEM). This more complete model reduces design time, especially when a number of candidate designs need to be analyzed. Otherwise, the calculation of the correction factors using FEM would be cumbersome, as the correction factors tend to be nonlinear.},

The present paper investigates the most promising passive damping methods for the LCL topology but also propose an overview of high order filters capable to offer even more attenuation than the LCL filter at a reduced size. This is the case of more recently introduced LCL topology with tuned traps. However, it is shown that by decreasing the size of the passive elements the robustness of the filter also is decreased. Thus, a comparison of the filter features including the robustness towards grid impedance variation, harmonic attenuation capability and losses in the damping circuit became interesting from a practical implementation point of view. The design of the proposed filters is validated by simulation and experimental results and covers two scenarios: high and low/medium power applications.},

abstract = {Wind farms (WFs) contribution in frequency deviations curtailment is a grey area, especially when WFs replace large conventional generation capacities. This study offers an algorithm to integrate hydro-pumped storage station (HPSS) to provide inertial and primary support, during frequency drops by utilising stored wind energy. However, wind turbines follow maximum power tracking, and do not apply frequency support methods, thus the wasted wind energy is mitigated. First, HPSS rated power and energy capacity are determined based on several givens, including wind speed and load characteristics. Thus, HPSS major aspects are estimated [e.g. pump(s), reservoir layout and generator(s)]. Second, offered algorithm coordinates energy storage, and releasing through several dynamic and static factors. HPSS output is continuously controlled through a timed approach to provide frequency support. A hypothetical system is inspired from Egyptian grid and real wind speed records at recommended locations to host WFs. Case studies examine the algorithm impact on frequency recovery, at 40{\%} wind power penetration. The responses of thermal generation and HPSS are analysed to highlight the influence of tuning the parameters of the proposed algorithm. The assessment of several frequency metrics insures the positive role of HPSS in frequency drops curtailment. Simulation environments are MATLAB and Simulink.

RES units, notably inverter-connected wind turbines and photovoltaics (PV) units that do not provide rotational inertia, are effectively displacing conventional generators and their rotating machinery. This has implications for frequency dynamics and power system operation: Since frequency dynamics are faster in power systems with low rotational inertia, this can lead to large transient frequency and power oscillations in multi-area power systems. Grid topology also has a key role for frequency dynamics as meshed grids are more resilient to disturbances than non-meshed grids. This paper investigates the role of low rotational inertia and different grid topology setups on power system stability for a three-area power system. The presented contributions, both analytical and simulation-based insights, extend previous results for a two-area power system.},

abstract = {It is necessary to maintain adequate contact pressure between a rail and an armature to avoid transition in a solid armature railgun. The contact pressure of the C-shaped armature at start-up arises from its initial mechanical interference. As armature wear grows and temperature rises, the initial mechanical interference decreases. When the current is established, the electromagnetic (EM) force provides the contact pressure. Transition usually occurs when the current ramps down, except for relatively light situations that have low currents and speeds. In this paper, launch experiments with armatures of the same geometry and material under different driving current amplitudes were performed. Based on the experimental results, the temperature rise of the armature with increasing action was analyzed. Then, the preload during the period of temperature increase was analyzed. In a simplified model, the EM force was also analyzed. The results indicate that the sum of preload and EM force has shown a decreasing trend. To reduce the consequence of EM force that decreases with current ramp-down, a partially augmented railgun, which could maintain adequate contact pressure in current ramp-down, is proposed. The feasibility of this kind of railgun is also analyzed.},

In this paper, a comprehensive overview on important issues affecting the distribution system as a result of PV penetration is presented. Pertinent issues such as voltage fluctuation, voltage rise, voltage balance, and harmonics and their effect on the system are discussed in details. The islanding issues, which are of critical importance to the stability and integrity of the system, are also thoroughly reviewed. Details on different islanding techniques - remote and local techniques and their advantage and disadvantages are shown. Therefore, this paper can provide useful information and serve as a reference for researchers and utility engineers on issues to be considered with regards to PV penetration.},

Then, possible future generator systems are reviewed. Hydraulic transmissions are significantly lighter than gearboxes and enable continuously variable transmission, but their efficiency is lower. A brushless DFIG is a medium speed generator without brushes and with improved low-voltage ride-through characteristics compared with the DFIG. Magnetic pseudo DDs are smaller and lighter than DD generators, but need a sufficiently low and stable magnet price to be successful. In addition, superconducting generators can be smaller and lighter than normal DD generators, but both cost and reliability need experimental demonstration.

In this paper, we present a method that uses voltage and current residual components to diagnose the phase and the severity of the ISF in PMSMs. A faulty-winding model (FWM) is introduced to analyze the fault; the model describes a relationship between the voltage decrease of the faulty winding to the characteristics of the fault such as a fault resistance and a fault turn ratio. Based on the model, we suggest a fault index (FI) that shows the severity of the ISF. As the ISF induces residual components to both voltage and current, the proposed method utilized those components with the FWM. A least squares (LS) method is used to estimate the FI and to diagnose the ISF of PMSMs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method diagnose the ISF effectively.},

The project started with the development of a new medium-caliber launcher (25 mm {\&}amp;times; 25 mm) named RAFIRA and a suitable loading system, as described in part I of the set of papers. This part II summarizes the major results obtained with RAFIRA in a single-shot mode and briefly explains the method of optimizing its performance. The experimental realization of the loading system described in part I is presented. First results regarding the performance of this loader are presented. Suitable conditions allowing multishot experiments were worked out. This paper concludes by presenting the first multishot experiments performed using the ISL armature technology. Already in the first tests, RAFIRA has accelerated projectiles up to more than 1000 m/s while achieving cadences around 30 Hz. The sliding contact performance of these experiments is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {In order to analyze the characteristics of energy loss distribution of the electromagnetic launcher (EML), a calculation model considering contact resistance, contact velocity skin effect, and friction force was established. First, a comparison between the calculation results and the experimental results was employed to verify the accuracy and the reliability of this model. Second, the energy loss of every component of the EML system was calculated and analyzed. Based on this model, the energy loss distribution is easily obtained and visually understood, which is helpful for the EML optimization design. Finally, we discussed the difference of the energy loss distribution between an augmented railgun with stainless steel containment and without containment. Results show that the stainless steel containment decreases the launch efficiency and make more electric energy transformed into resistance loss in the EML system.},

abstract = {A new electromagnetic-launcher (EML) perfor- mance parameter called the specific force is presented and ana- lyzed in this paper. The specific force is the second derivative of the EML's force equation with respect to current and represents the force generated by the EML per unit square ampere, i.e., the EML's current efficiency. The specific force is independent of operating current and is defined for EMLs utilizing linear and nonlinear magnetic materials. The second derivative is termed as the specific force, since it unifies the various EML geometries so that only one force equation is required. The specific force, together with the energy-conversion efficiency, can be used as criterion to evaluate and compare EML geometries for various applications. The specific force for conventional railguns, aug- mented railguns, conventional helical launchers, and high-efficiency helical launchers is derived in this paper. The experimental performance of conventional railguns, augmented railguns, and conventional helical launchers are also analyzed in terms of their specific-force parameters. Index},

abstract = {This paper investigates the active damping of LCL-filter resonance within single-loop grid current control of grid-connected voltage source converters. First, the basic analysis in the continuous s-domain reveals that the grid-current-feedback active damping forms a virtual impedance across the grid-side inductor, and the use of a high-pass filter with a negative sign shapes the virtual impedance by an RL damper paralleled by a negative inductance. It is further found that such a negative virtual inductance plays a critical role in mitigating the phase lag caused by the time delay in a digital control system. The instability induced by the negative virtual resistance, which is commonly experienced in the feedback-type active damping, can thus be avoided. A systematic design method of the highpass filter is also proposed by the help of root locus analysis in the discrete z-domain. Lastly, experimental tests are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.},

Based on the analysis, the impact of interleaving on the design of ac passive components, such as ac line inductor and electromagnetic interference (EMI) filter, is discussed. The results show that interleaving has the potential benefit to reduce ac passive components. To maximize such a benefit, the interleaving angle should be optimized according to the system requirements, including total harmonic distortion limit, ripple limit, or EMI standards, while considering operating conditions, such as modulation index and PWM schemes. Experimental results have verified the analysis results.},

The alternate arrangement of winding coils is designed to eliminate a harmonic component of back electromotive force that gives rise to a harmonic component of pulsating torque. However, the non-uniform arrangement of slots decreases the frequency of the cogging torque by half and may aggravate torque pulsation. To compensate for the drawback or the decrease in the frequency of the cogging torque, dummy slots are introduced in the alternately slotted stator. A theoretical method is developed for the proposed stator combination. The proposed stator design is applied to a prototype in combination with other rotor magnet design techniques, such as magnet shifting and the adjustment of magnet width, to minimize pulsating torque. The results show that the designed motor reduces the ripple factor of the torque by approximately 30{\%} relative to the original value. In addition, the proposed alternate slot winding is validated by comparing the design with equal slot-winding designs optimized through finite-element method analysis.},

An important consequence of this situation is their effect on total system inertia and the ability to overcome the system's frequency disturbances. The wind power industry has created a controller to enable inertial response on wind turbines generators: Synthetic Inertial. This paper evaluates the effects of the inertia emulation of wind turbines based on full-converters and their effect on total system inertia after frequency disturbances happen. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate (based on simulations) that during an under-frequency transients on future power systems, synthetic inertia does not completely avoid worse scenarios in terms of under-frequency load shedding. The extra power delivered from a wind turbine during frequency disturbances can increase “momentary” the total system inertia and substantially reduce the rate of change of frequency providing time for the active governors to respond. However, synthetic inertia might not completely avoid under-frequency load shedding.},

abstract = {The use of power converters is very important in maximizing the power transfer from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, or even a hydrogen-based fuel cell to the utility grid. An LCL filter is often used to interconnect an inverter to the utility grid in order to filter the harmonics produced by the inverter. Although there is an extensive amount of literature available describing LCL filters, there has been a gap in providing a systematic design methodology. Furthermore, there has been a lack of a state-space mathematical modeling approach that considers practical cases of delta- and wye-connected capacitors showing their effects on possible grounding alternatives. This paper describes a design methodology of an LCL filter for grid-interconnected inverters along with a comprehensive study of how to mitigate harmonics. The procedures and techniques described in this paper may be used in small-scale renewable energy conversion systems and may be also retrofitted for medium- and large-scale grid-connected systems.},

abstract = {Wind energy technology is evolving towards larger machines (longer blades, taller towers and more powerful generators). Scaling up wind turbines is a challenging task, which requires innovative solutions as well as new configurations and de- signs. The size of wind turbines (in terms of rotor diameter, hub height and rated power) has increased extraordinary from 30m rotor diameter, 30m of hub height and 300kW rated power, usual in the late 1980s, to 92.7m rotor diameter, 87.7m of height and 2.1MW on average at the end of 2014. However, technological evolution has not only been focused on the scaling up process but also on developing innovative solutions that minimize costs at the same time as they deal with as- pects of different nature, such as grid code requirements, reliability, quality of the wind resource or prices and availability of certain commodities, among others. This paper analyses the evolution of wind technology from a market-based perspective by identifying trends in the most relevant technological indicators at the same time as stressing the key differentiating aspects between regions/markets. Evo- lution and trends in indicators such as rated power, rotor diameter, hub height, specific power, wind class, drive train con- figuration and power control systems are presented and analysed, showing an intense and fast technological development, which is enabling wind energy to reduce costs and becoming increasingly more competitive with conventional fuel-based generating technologies. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors Wind Energy Published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {We have been developing a plasma armature railgun with two distributed power supplies as the first step to produce a railgun with multiple distributed power supplies, which is considered as a promising tool for hypervelocities. The railgun has almost the same system and operational principle as those of the two-stage plasma armature railgun, which had been developed in our laboratory, except that the two power supplies are distributed along segmented rails or continuous rails. To date, we have performed 11 shots to study the railgun. For the operation of the railgun with two distributed power supplies, to control the generation of a compact plasma armature in the 2{\textless}sup{\textgreater}nd{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} railgun bore is the most important. In 8 shots the compact structure of the plasma armature was not generated due to a large amount of leakage of the plasma armature around the joint between the two railguns. However in the remaining 3 shots, the deformation of the railgun bore around the railgun joint, which is considered to be the main reason for the leakage of the plasma armature, was able to be suppressed. As a result, the compact structure of the plasma armature in the 2{\textless}sup{\textgreater}nd{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} railgun bore was generated. Based on the experimental results, we are now planning to perform the next-step experiment with a higher power supply energy.},

abstract = {The injected grid current regulator and active damping of the LCL filter are essential to the control of LCL-type grid-connected inverters. Generally speaking, the current regulator guarantees the quality of the injected grid current, and the active damping reduces the resonance peak caused by the LCL filter and makes it easier to stabilize the whole system. However, the frequency responses of the current regulator and active damping interact with each other, making it difficult to design the proper controller parameters and investigate the effect of the controller parameters. Taking proportional-integral (PI) compensator together with capacitor-current-feedback active-damping as an instance, this paper proposes a step-by-step design method of the current regulator and capacitor current feedback coefficient in both analog control and digital control. By carefully dealing with the interaction between the current regulator and active damping, the satisfactory regions of the controller parameters are obtained based on stability margin and steady-state error checking, making it more convenient and explicit to optimize the performance of the system. The convenient trial-and-error procedures are successfully reduced. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed design method.},

abstract = { The thermophysical properties of a novel aluminum alloy are investigated. This alloy, GIGAS 30, is appealing for its increased mechanical properties compared to aluminum alloys commonly used for armatures (e.g., Al 6061, 7075). A pulsed current is used to generate the source of thermal loading. A thermocouple is used to measure the temperature rise of the material. The structure to contain the material during the discharge is configured so that very little force loading is generated during the discharge. Hence, the material failure can be essentially characterized from thermal loads alone. Finally, the thermophysical properties measured are used to assess the relative and absolute benefits and burdens when the material is selected for use in designing an integrated launch package for a railgun application. It is found that the marginal increase in breech energy and parasitic mass from the increased resistivity and density is compensated by the increased structural benefits, resulting in slightly increased system efficiency. Moreover, significant insight into material selection can be gained by using the integrated design methodology rather than selection based on one particular material property.},

abstract = {Transition is an important issue in rail electromagnetic launches; it
limits the performance of electromagnetic launch systems. In launch
progresses, wear on the contact surface of armature significantly
affects the contact surface morphology and armature structure. Studying
wear, contact resistance, and sliding friction coefficient of the
contact surface between the armature and the rail is important to
understand and suppress transitions. In this paper, specially designed
armatures, which make the wear on armature contact surface all melt
wear, are used in rail launch experiments, to measure the wear rate of
melt wear and observe how it is affect by loading. In the experimental
results, average wear rate is represented by the average thickness of
aluminum debris left on the rails: the average wear rate is within 0.6-2
mm/m and the average debris thickness is in a range of 3-10 mu m. Based
on the idea that melt wearing is the main mechanism, the heat balance of
contact surface is analyzed. It is concluded that melt wear absorbs much
of the heat generated in the surface, and the remainder goes into the
rails. Equations based on this heat balance based are then derived to
establish relationship among melt wear, launch parameters, and material
parameters. According to the equations and the experimental results, the
contact resistance of armatures with 80 mm(2) contact areas is 2.56 mu
Omega, the contact resistance of armatures with 50 mm(2) contact areas
is 4.09 mu Omega and the sliding friction coefficient is 0.11.},

The phase shift between the stator windings in each motor is 30 degrees, and the motors can also operate with only one stator system in case that another system is lost. The second example is LNG carriers, where one propeller is driven through a gearbox by two 12 to 15 MW dual-stator synchronous motors. The motors are supplied by VSI-type frequency converters with double inverter units and supply units, allowing each motor to operate in half power mode in case of a fault in any of these modules.

With this technique, PM motors can change negative salient poles into positive salient poles by applying the magnetization of the PM. Furthermore, we discuss the combi-nation of reversible salient poles with variable magnetic force to increase the efficiency of the motor under partial load. This paper proposes a novel PM motor that uses our proposed technique to reverse saliency and describes the principle of reversible pole saliency as well as the resulting motor characteristics. When the proposed motor operates with a negative salient pole, a higher torque is produced at low speeds; when the motor reverses to a positive salient pole, higher power and efficiency are produced at high speeds. These results confirm that the proposed motor can reverse the saliency direction of the pole and that this reversibility allows the motor to achieve high torque at low speeds and high power at high speeds. Consequently, the motor can operate over a wide range of speeds.},

New embedded control functions are therefore required in order to make participate wind generators in power system management. In this paper the implementation of inertial response and primary frequency control in a wind turbine controller are investigated. Main factors affecting the performances of the frequency regulation are identified and characterized. The influence of control parameters and the turbine operating point on the inertial response are analyzed through obtained performances in an islanded power system. The combined control scheme using both controllers is also developed and the potential of the obtained grid service at partial load is discussed.},

Finally, a prototype machine is fabricated, and experiments are carried out to test its performances and electromagnetic features.

The key of the proposed machine is to make tooth widths unequal of inner stator, hence, offering more trapezoidal back-EMF waveform. Due to the fact that the radial PMs are embedded in the outer rotor, the proposed machine incorporates the merits of high torque-to-weight ratio, mechanical robustness, and high air-gap flux density. In addition, multiphase and single-layer fractional slot concentrated windings are employed to improve the reliability. The electromagnetic characteristics of the proposed machine are analyzed by using the time-stepping finite-element method (FEM) and field-circuit cosimulation method, such as magnetic field distribution, flux destiny, flux linkage, and torque, verifying the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.},

Finally, the fault diagnosis steps are presented. This method is capable of detecting the fault, evaluating the fault severity, and identifying the faulty phases.

characteristics of these armatures are illuminated. A C-shaped armature
is simulated based on the electrical-magnetic-mechanical coupled
analysis method. The simulation shows that the stress is mainly
distributed in the area between the cross member and arm, it may lead to
local deformation. A novel concave armature is proposed and the
simulation results indicate that the stress is mainly distributed in the
inner side of arm and the front of armature. It is beneficial to push
heavy load and avoid deformation and fracture. A device is built to
validate the feasibility of armature. The armature is staying still to
simulate pushing the infinite heavy load. The experimental results show
that the concave armature endures higher current and has the stronger
capability of pushing load compared with the C-shaped armature. This
type of armature provides a valuable reference for future armature

This study explored a range of bore and rail geometries and looked at their effects on key railgun system parameters such as parasitic mass, inductance gradient, linear current density, required pulse forming network (PFN) size, and barrel mass. Preliminary solid modeling and structural analysis of the integrated launch package was performed in order to quantify parasitic mass. Inductance gradient calculations were based on a current density distribution analysis. A PFN/Launcher numerical simulation model was then used to determine linear current density and PFN size. Finally, barrel mass was estimated by structural analysis based on calculated rail repulsive forces. Trends and sensitivities of the different parameters to changes in the bore and rail geometries are presented and conclusions are given.},

abstract = {As inductive energy-storage technology presents-at the same power-output capability-energy densities that are one order of magnitude higher than those of capacitive storage, its use is very interesting for pulsed-power applications. An additional advantage is the capability of inductors to generate any voltage required for discharge. In other words, if a high-voltage discharge is necessary, the inductors can still be charged at a low voltage-in contrast to capacitors. An XRAM generator is an inductive energy-storage device capable of multiplying the charging current by its number of stages. The obstacle to be overcome when operating XRAM generators is the need for opening switches capable of interrupting the charging current. Here, an improved version of a countercurrent-commutation circuit developed at and patented for the ISL allows charging currents of at least 28 kA per XRAM stage to be switched off safely. A 20-stage XRAM generator could thus deliver 20 {\&}{\#}x00D7; 28 kA = 560 kA to a low-impedance load, e.g., a railgun. We report on the design and first tests of a 20-stage countercurrent switched toroidal XRAM generator demonstrator model, designed for charging currents of up to 3 kA, i.e., 60 kA in the load. The compact demonstrator has a circular ground plate with a diameter of 100 cm, and the height of the installation is 25 cm. The toroidal-coil arrangement provides a very good containment of the magnetic field and, consequently, a high efficiency.},

A curve tracer was used to measure Rds-on across the full operating temperature range, as well as the self-commutated reverse conduction (i.e. diode-like) behavior. Other static parameters such as transconductance and gate current were also measured. A double pulse test setup was constructed and used to measure switching loss and time at the fastest achievable switching speed, and the subsequent over-voltages due to the fast switching were characterized.

The system with two different LCL filters is considered, one with the iron core inductors and the other with the air core inductors. In that way the influence of the iron losses on the system stability is investigated. It is shown that the stability margins obtained by means of the nonlinear model simulation are somewhat wider than the ones obtained by the root locus technique.

abstract = {This paper proposes a stator design that consists of a combination of an alternate slot winding and dummy slots to minimize pulsating torque in surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motors. The alternate arrangement of winding coils is designed to eliminate a harmonic component of back electromotive force that gives rise to a harmonic component of pulsating torque. However, the non-uniform arrangement of slots decreases the frequency of the cogging torque by half and may aggravate torque pulsation. To compensate for the drawback or the decrease in the frequency of the cogging torque, dummy slots are introduced in the alternately slotted stator. A theoretical method is developed for the proposed stator combination. The proposed stator design is applied to a prototype in combination with other rotor magnet design techniques, such as magnet shifting and the adjustment of magnet width, to minimize pulsating torque. The results show that the designed motor reduces the ripple factor of the torque by approximately 30{\%} relative to the original value. In addition, the proposed alternate slot winding is validated by comparing the design with equal slot-winding designs optimized through finite-element method analysis.},

Recovered aluminum alloy armatures show evidence of plastic deformation, melting, and even cracking in the throat region. Plastic deformation can result from magnetic pinch or thermal expansion forces and melting from ohmic heating. Although cracking is historically associated with grain boundary melting, the cracks observed in recently recovered armatures are likely a result of thermal stresses. Finite-element codes EMAP3D and DYNA3D were linked to assess stresses generated by magnetic forces, inertial loading, wear, and thermal expansions. For low-speed armatures, thermal stresses were found to be as important as magnetic stresses. The observed cracking is likely due to rapid cooling, similar to quench cracking, and may or may not occur during launch},

In order to determine critical parameters concerning the transition of brush armatures, a series of experiments was performed using the ISL-EMA3 railgun (DES, 3 m, 15{\&}times;30 mm2, 620 kJ). The maximum muzzle velocity obtained during these experiments was about 1200 m/s. A qualitative model of brush-rail contact, assuming that contact transition is mainly due to mass loss of brushes, is presented. The mechanisms causing mass loss were investigated.

abstract = {Increasing power system flexibility by responsive demand is a central issue for the incorporation of higher levels of variable wind generation in future power systems. The electrification of the heat sector, except from energy efficiency gains, may offer a vast potential of new forms of flexible demand, by time-shifting of heat production in buildings. The assessment of this potential can, however, be performed only when the limitations imposed by the primary operation of the equipment (space heating) are realistically taken into account. In this paper, a methodology is presented for the quantification of the flexibility offered by the thermal storage of building stock equipped with heat pumps, to power systems with significant penetration of wind power. A model is proposed for the incorporation of the building stock thermal behavior as equivalent energy storage in electricity market models. At the same time, the model allows the coupling to a detailed dynamic thermal model of buildings for the assessment of the respective operational restrictions. The case study presents the results of a project for the evaluation of the flexibility offered by portfolios of high heat pump deployment in conjunction with high wind penetration scenarios for the future German electricity system.},

abstract = {The increasing penetration of variable speed wind turbines in the electricity grid will result in a reduction of the number of connected conventional power plants. This will lead to a reduction of inertia in the grid, as the rotational speed of a variable speed turbine and the grid are decoupled by a power electronic converter. A lower system inertia will result in larger and faster frequency deviations after occurrence of abrupt variations in generation and load. It is possible to implement an additional control loop in the power electronic converter of the turbine, which connects the turbine inertia directly to the grid. It is even possible, by control, to make a 'virtual inertia' that is larger than the real inertia. During a frequency drop additional power can be released to the grid with this control. This behaviour will be called inertial response. The additional power is obtained from the kinetic energy that is stored in the rotating mass of the turbine. In this contribution two different control strategies are investigated and compared with each other. A type of control that is equal to the primary frequency control of large power plants shows the best results, both with respect to the power that is needed to limit the frequency drop and with respect to electrical and mechanical stress of the turbine. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Advantages of the magnetic obturator include lower mass than conventional "C-type" railgun armatures (approaching the theoretical minimum mass), compatibility with mid-drive sabots, and the potential for nontransitioning operation. The Institute for Advanced Technology (IAT) at The University of Texas at Austin began testing magnetic obturators in 1997. Our tests showed that magnetic obturators can operate very well, but not yet as reliably as C-type armatures. This paper discusses experiments conducted to understand and resolve several recurrent problems that include difficulties associated with start-up, high contact pressures leading to local yielding of copper rails, and susceptibility to develop intermittent arcing contact before transition. This paper reports our progress in addressing these three areas and presents recommendations for further research.},

abstract = {This thesis focuses on permanent magnet "direct drive" electrical generators for wind turbines with large power output. A variety of such generator topologies is reviewed, tested and optimised in an attempt to increase their potential as commercial concepts for the wind industry. Direct drive electrical generators offer a reliable alternative to gearbox drivetrains. This novel technology reduces energy loses thus allowing more energy to be yield from the wind and decreases the maintenance cost at the same time. A fundamental issue for these generators is their large size which makes them difficult to manufacture, transport and assembly. A number of structural designs have been suggested in the literature in an attempt to minimise this attribute. A set of design tools are set out in an attempt to investigate the structural stiffness of the different permanent magnet direct drive generator topologies against a number of structural stresses that apply to such wind turbine energy converters. Optimisation techniques, both analytical and structural, are also developed for minimising the total mass of a variety of "directly driven" machines with power output of 5MW or greater. Conventional and promising generator designs are modelled and optimised with the use of these optimisation techniques. The topologies under examination are then compared in terms of structural mass, stiffness and cost. As the number of wind turbine manufactures who adopt the direct drive concept increases, it is important to outline the unique characteristics of the different topologies and increase their manufacturing potential. Discussions and conclusions will provide an indication of the design solutions that could help decrease the mass and cost of such machines.},

abstract = {Interturn short-circuit faults that occur inside stator coils are difficult to cope with compared with terminal short-circuit faults. A general analytical model for interturn short-circuit faults is developed that employs a novel T-type equivalent circuit. When this model is used to investigate the impact of interturn short-circuit faults in permanent-magnet (PM) machines with fractional slot concentrated windings (FSCW), the model delivers fault response predictions that agree very well with results from the finite element analysis. The model is used to show that the 24-slot/14-pole FSCW PM machine is vulnerable to very high interturn fault currents, even when the remaining turns are shorted, offsetting its advantage of low magnetic coupling between phases. FSCW-PM machines that employ aligned coils in phase windings can effectively suppress their interturn fault currents. Experimental verifications are provided for the 24-slot/22-pole FSCW PM prototype machine (with two aligned coils per phase) under the single-turn short-circuit fault. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {Inverters adopted in distributed power generation, active filter, and uninterruptible power supply are often connected to the grid through an inductance-capacitor-inductance (LCL) filter. The impedance of the LCL filter has a typical frequency characteristic with a resonance peak. Hence, the LCL filter has to be damped in order to avoid instability. However, the resonance of the LCL filter can be also excited in a controlled way in order to individuate the resonance frequency in the spectrum (using for example the fast Fourier transform). This paper proposes to use a controlled excitation in measuring the grid impedance, since this one influences also the resonance frequency. This paper will address some possible limits, some solutions, and some implementation issues (e.g., how to obtain a controlled resonance in the filter without damaging the system) in order to use the resonant peak for grid impedance detection. The analysis is validated both by simulations and experimental results.},

@article{Holmes1996,
abstract = {Pulsewidth modulation has been one of the most intensively investigated areas of power electronics for many years, and the number and combination of permutations seem to be endless. However, a general hierarchical consensus appears to have emerged from this work which ranks space vector modulation techniques, regular sampled modulation, and sine-triangle modulation strategies in decreasing order of merit based on harmonic performance. However, what has not been clearly identified is why space vector modulation should lead to a reduced harmonic current ripple compared to regular sampled modulation, especially since it is straightforward to show that they produce identical low-frequency fundamental components. This paper addresses this issue by showing how it is the placement of the zero space vector component within the carrier interval that determines the harmonic performance of the modulation strategy, rather than any intrinsic differences between the various methods of calculating the switching instances},

abstract = {Adequate contact pressure needs to be applied at electrical contacts to overcome contact separation force due to current constriction effects. In the railgun operation, the initial contact pressure is provided by the interference pressure between the armature and the rail. As the magnetic field is established in the bore, the electromagnetic force provides the contact pressure, as the initial contact pressure reduces due to wear or contact melting. Excessive initial contact pressure may delay the motion of the armature and cause overheating of the armature. On the other hand, insufficient initial pressure would result in contact separation of armature and rail. The contact interface is never perfectly smooth. It only contacts at discrete asperities at micro scale and at discrete points due to deformation of the contact interface at macro scale. The interface characteristics are different from the bulk behavior. A detailed model of contact resistivity is essential to compute the interfacial current density and temperature distributions accurately. A contact resistivity model was developed that is a function of contact pressure, the hardness of the softer contact member, average bulk resistivity, and contact constants. The model was implemented into the code EMAP3D. This paper presents the simulation results of the start-up of a sample railgun with and without contact resistivity.},

abstract = {This paper reports the results of 3-D numerical simulations of the Joule heating of armatures and rails in railguns. Armatures of various shapes with homogeneous and orthotropic electrical conductivity, homogeneous rails, and rails with a resistive coating are considered. It is shown that the maximum current density is reached at the perimeter of the rail-armature interface. The current-density value and, hence, the armature-heating dynamics are significantly affected by the armature shape and the electrothermal properties of the armature and rail materials, as well as by the acceleration dynamics, which, in turn, is determined by the total current value in the electromagnetic launcher and the total mass of the projectile. The ultimate projectile velocities are obtained when the Joule heating of the rails and armature by electric current during the shot does not tend to increase the temperature at any point of the railgun above its melting point. By controlling the structure and properties of rail materials, it is possible to reach ultimate (in terms of heating conditions) velocities much higher than those with homogeneous materials.},

abstract = {Gallium nitride (GaN) light emitting diodes (LEDs) were irradiated at room temperature with electrons in the range 300-1400 keV. A threshold energy of 440 keV was observed, corresponding to a gallium atom displacement energy of 19±2 eV. This value of the displacement energy compares with that of silicon carbide but is smaller than that of diamond and larger than that of gallium arsenide (GaAs). No threshold energy for the nitrogen atom was observed. It is concluded that the nitrogen sublattice repairs itself through annealing. The measured displacement energy is used to determine the Rutherford cross section, which permits a theoretical comparison of electron and proton irradiation damage in GaN. The effects of 2.5 MeV electrons on gallium nitride films have been studied by photoluminescence (PL), and according to the literature, they introduce transitions in the near infrared part of the spectrum. Experiments on gallium nitride films using 2 MeV protons are reported in this work. The same transitions in the near infrared part of the spectrum are observed by PL. It is deduced that 2 MeV protons are about 1000 times more damaging than 2.5 MeV electrons. The Rutherford cross section predicts a value of 214. The difference is attributed to the defect recombination rate which depends on the particle type. The nature of the transitions in the near infrared part of the spectrum is reviewed. The GaN films were annealed at 400°C for 30 min. As a result of annealing, another transition appears in the green part of the spectrum. Transitions involving the gallium vacancy in irradiated GaN are discussed.},

While many electric vehicles (Evs) are on the market, they are not as cost competitive as conventional vehicles, and affordable cost is necessary for large-scale market penetration. For this to become a reality, continued research is needed to develop new cost-efficient technologies. this article presents the met-rics and benchmarks used to gauge the performance of various electric drive-trains. in addition, current state-of-the-art technologies are presented in terms of these metrics as well as the future goals and trends in the industry.

Automotive Industry Advancements the Ev and hybrid-electric-vehicle (hEv) market has been growing over the years and continues to grow today. influenced by both government regulations and consumer demand, auto manufacturers have continued to pursue technologies to improve efficiency and fuel economy. as the market progresses, continued research and develop-ment are required to enable the large-scale market pene-tration of Evs and hEvs in the future. in particular, there are three main areas in which current research aims to improve the vehicle: electric motors, power electronics, and energy storage. this article describes the evolution of these technologies and lays out the road map for future technological development and implementation in Evs and hEvs [1], [2]. Evs can trace their inception as far back as the early 20th century; however, they were quickly overmatched by the influx of the internal-combustion engine (icE). the advantage that the icE had was its energy-storage capaci-ty; as it was capable of providing longer ranges of travel at a lower fuel cost. however, by the end of the 20th century, technological improvements in electric machines, power electronics, and energy storage sparked increased efforts in Ev development. today, Evs and hEvs have a consider-able share of the automotive marketplace, which is led by major car companies around the world. new technologies will continue to revolutionize the industry and lead to large-scale adaptations of these cars [3], [4]. apart from technology trends, this article will also present perfor-mance requirements that have been set for the future. cur-rent and potential future states of the state-of-the-art technologies will be described, as updated from those dis-cussed in [25].},

The tests utilized channels of various sizes and geometries machined into the rail contact surface of the armatures to see if ejecta could be controlled. These tests identified several channel patterns as having the potential to delay the onset of armature ejecta. A series of multiple-shot tests was subsequently conducted in a larger railgun having a bore cross section of 38 {\&}{\#}x00D7; 76 mm. The goal of these experiments was to see if the channel patterns that delayed armature ejecta had a significant impact on rail erosion at start-up. Three test series were conducted. In the first series, three armatures with a nested circular channel pattern were tested. In the second series, three armatures with a large centrally located channel were tested. Both armature designs used equivalent contact areas. These results were then compared to a standard armature contact face with no modifications in a third test series.},

abstract = {In this study, a robust fault-tolerant predictive current control (RFT-PCC) algorithm based on composite observer is proposed for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs), which can eliminate the influence of motor parameter perturbation and permanent magnet demagnetization. First, the effects of the parameter perturbation and permanent magnet demagnetization on the current vector are analyzed based on the conventional predictive current control (PCC). The composite observer based on sliding mode observer and Luenberger observer is then designed to observe the compensation voltage and current prediction value of the next time simultaneously. Finally, a RFT-PCC method is developed. The proposed RFT-PCC is able to effectively enhance robustness against parameter perturbation and permanent magnet demagnetization by adding compensation voltage. The current prediction value of the next time is used for replacing the sampled current in RFT-PCC to compensate for the influence of the one-step delay. Comparative simulations and experimentations verify that the proposed RFT-PCC can improve the robustness while maintaining quick dynamic response of the current control loops.},

abstract = {Hybrid armatures have potential advantages over solid and plasma$\backslash$narmatures because they could have a reduced axial length and$\backslash$nconsequently a lower mass than the former and lower resistive losses$\backslash$nthan the latter. However it is expected that their use could result in$\backslash$nexcessive arcing erosion damage to the rails at low velocity and$\backslash$nincreased forces in the rail/armature gap due to partial confinement of$\backslash$nthe arcing energy losses in this region. In this transitioning hybrid$\backslash$narmature concept, it is proposed to overcome these problems by having$\backslash$ninitially a solid armature contact region, armature arcing surfaces of a$\backslash$nlow erosion rate metal and an {\&}ldquo;open{\&}rdquo; armature geometry. The$\backslash$nlatter allows the rapid expansion of arcing and erosion products$\backslash$nradially inwards from the small rail/armature gap to the much larger$\backslash$nbore volume. The armature will be mainly of aluminum alloy with the$\backslash$nsolid contact region being located at the armature rear with dimensions$\backslash$nlimited to achieve a predetermined transition velocity of about 1.0$\backslash$nkm/s. The armature surface forward of the solid contact region is not in$\backslash$ncontact with the rails and is {\&}ldquo;clad{\&}rdquo; with a high temperature$\backslash$nlow erosion rate metal such as a tungsten/copper/nickel alloy to$\backslash$nminimize the armature arcing erosion depth and consequently the are$\backslash$nvoltage and energy losses.

The system has been validated by numerical simulation using data from a wind farm with 37 variable-speed wind turbine situated in the North of Spain.

The dc bus capacitor presents a significant barrier to meeting inverter cost, volume, and weight requirements for mass production of affordable EVs/HEVs. The large ripple currents become even more problematic for the film capacitors (the capacitor technology of choice for EVs/HEVs) in high temperature environments as their ripple current handling capability decreases rapidly with rising temperatures. It is shown in previous work that segmenting the VSI based traction drive system can significantly decrease the ripple currents and thus the size of the dc bus capacitor.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. Wind variations are important to consider while designing inertia support strategies. A model has been evaluated but the findings should reflect issues with several control strategies utilizing a fixed inertia support pattern. Wind variability of 0.5 m/s from second to second is observed in real wind data. However, drastic changes in wind speed can occur within the duration of inertia support. An improved inertia control algorithm has been presented allowing a stable delivery of inertia support from variable speed wind turbines (VSWT) subjected to realistic wind conditions. The controller improves the previously presented inertia algorithm and smoothly transitions from a locked operation window to MPPT-operation. The impact of the utilized wind speed filter is described and its impact on the simulation found to be of great importance.},

sensors based on the colossal magnetoresistance effect can be used to
measure the magnetic field distribution in the vicinity of the rails of
a railgun. However, the data obtained suffered from electromagnetic
interference. Therefore, the measurement system was considerably
improved to obtain better signal quality. In this paper, the results
obtained during the dynamic operation of the ISL railgun RAFIRA are
presented. The magnetic field distribution in the vicinity of the rails
was measured at different armature velocities. Additional information
was obtained using high-speed camera snapshots. The experimental results
are compared with simulations performed with the finite element code
COMSOL Multiphysics. In particular, the influence of the armature
current on the measurements is discussed. It is concluded that the
magnetic field distribution in the vicinity of the rails clearly
indicates an increased current concentration in the rear part of the
armature-rail contact interface. Moreover, the current concentration
depends on the speed of the armature. Velocity-dependent skin depths at
the surface of aluminum (Dural) rails for projectile velocities ranging
between 750 and 1500 m/s are investigated.},

abstract = {Railgun tribology describes the friction and wear sciences of interacting surfaces in relative motion. The novel tribological feature of railguns is the use of high-speed, high-current sliding electrical contacts for the conversion of the electrical energy in a current pulse into projectile kinetic energy. Several wear processes affect the life of components used to construct the bore of a railgun depending upon the severity of the duty cycle. Following multishot testing without refurbishment in solid-armature railguns, wear products have been observed to accumulate on the contact surfaces of rail conductors. Aluminum-alloy armatures produce wear debris that is chemically complex and structurally inhomogeneous. Because electromagnetic propulsion requires that electrical conduction take place across these debris layers, it is important to understand the factors that influence their structure. A critical question for repeatable and predictable railgun performance and for extended rail life is whether easy conduction occurs through these accumulated wear products. It is possible to control the dimensions and properties of these wear debris accumulations on rail contact surfaces using chemical and mechanical aids. Films of rapidly solidified aluminum with layered structures and high levels of gas porosity are the most common debris on copper rails. It is possible to control the structures of these films and to plow them away when they grow thick. Here, results of characterization and control of wear debris are presented and discussed},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {—With increasing wind penetration levels on power sys-tems worldwide, conventional thermal plant, along with the an-cillary services they provide are being displaced. To address this issue, modern variable speed wind turbines can offer a short-term controlled response to temporary power imbalances, by harnessing their stored rotational energy, a so called emulated, or synthetic, in-ertial response. However, unlike conventional frequency response services, the emulated inertial response is dependent on the wind turbine operating condition and provides a response which is dis-tinct to that from synchronously connected plant. While much re-search has investigated the harnessing of such a response from wind turbines and its effect on system frequency, this paper in-vestigates potential issues associated with the system-wide integra-tion of the technology at scale. The ability for wind generation to provide frequency support through emulated inertia is assessed, as well as the potential for tuning such a distributed response re-source to ensure timely and effective frequency recovery under dif-ferent system conditions. It is shown that the frequency response capability of future systems and the operating protocols for system participants, including wind generation, will require development if emulated inertia technology is adopted at scale.},

This CM circulating current can be separated into two separate components based on their frequency; the high-frequency component, close to the switching frequency, can be effectively limited by means of passive components; the low-frequency component, close to the fundamental frequency, embodies the jumping CM circulating current observed in parallel VSCs. This is the main reason why it is usually recommended not to implement discontinuous and interleaving PWM together. The origin of this low-frequency circulating current is analyzed in detail, and based on this, a method to eliminate its presence is proposed by impeding the simultaneous use of different zero vectors between the converters. This control method only requires six additional switching actions per line cycle, presenting a minimum impact on the converter thermal design. The analysis and the feasibility of the control method are verified by simulation and experimental results.},

abstract = {This thesis presents an investigation of how a direct-driven wind turbine generator should be designed and how small and efficient such a generator will be. Advantages and disadvantages of various types of direct-driven wind turbine generators are discussed, and a radial-flux permanent-magnet generator connected to a forced-commutated rectifier is chosen for a detailed theoretical investigation. Further, a design method is developed for the electromagnetic part of the chosen generator type. The generator is optimized with a simplified cost function which, besides including the cost of the active generator parts and the cost of the structure, also includes the cost of the average losses. Therefore, a method to calculate the average losses is derived. The design method is used to investigate the optimization of a 500 kW generator, and the size, efficiency and active weight of optimized generators from 30 kW to 3 MW are presented. A result of the investigation is that the outer diameters of the direct-driven generators are only slightly larger than the width of conventional wind energy converter nacelles. A comparison of average efficiency shows that direct-driven generators, including the losses in the frequency converters, are more efficient than conventional wind energy converter drive trains. Compared with other direct-driven generators, the proposed generator type is small, mainly because of the forced- commutated rectifier and because the generator is not required to produce a pull-out torque higher than the rated torque.},

abstract = {PV inverters are an important element of the future smart grids. Not only they contribute to the active power generation as distributed generators (DGs), but also they can help grid voltage/frequency stability by generating VAR. Although the number of PV installations is rapidly growing, the effective utilization of PV inverters remains low. As even if inverters are to operate in VAR mode during night hours, they still need some active power to compensate for their internal losses, regulate the DC bus and provide the desired level of reactive power. This paper will provide a detailed analysis of PV inverters' operation in VAR compensation mode when active power is not available. A new control scheme is proposed that enables inverter to absorb little active power from grid, regulate its DC bus voltage within limits, and inject the desired level of reactive power. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the analysis.},

First, different types of common WECSs are classified according to their features and drive train types. The WECSs are compared on the basis of the volume, weight, cost, efficiency, system reliability and fault ride through capability. The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control, which aims to make the generator speed meet an optimum value to ensure the maximum energy yield, plays a key role in the variable speed WECSs. A comprehensive review and comparison of the four most popular MPPT control methods are carried out and improvements for each method are presented. Furthermore, the latest development of wind energy conversion technologies is introduced, such as the brushless doubly fed induction generator (BDFIG), the stator permanent magnet synchronous generators, the magnetic-geared generators, dual power flow WECS with the electrical variable transmission (EVT) machine, and direct grid-connected WECS. Finally, the future trends of the technologies are discussed.},

This result is also verified experimentally, and a 10:1 range is demonstrated.

abstract = {Diffusion-controlled erosion of armatures, which is accentuated by the velocity skin effect, gives rise to nonuniform current conduction and consequent nonuniform heating. Earlier computational studies have highlighted the role played by armature geometry in current density and temperature distribution. Recently, we designed modified C-shaped armatures, called saddle-shaped armatures, to study the effect of geometry change on armature erosion and its consequent effect on rail deposits. The trailing edge and the throat of the armature were curved to better align with the magnetic field, thus reducing the nonuniformity of current density distribution. A front tab was also provided to reduce current concentration and heating at the leading edge of the contact area. Low-speed tests, in which armatures were recovered and compared with recovered conventional C-shaped armatures, were conducted. Similar experiments at speeds above 2 km/s were conducted and compared with corresponding C-shaped armature experiments. It was found that in conformation with our hypothesis, the saddle-shaped armatures recovered from low-speed shots showed less erosion both on the contact surface and in the throat area. The high-speed tests showed that the contact voltage for saddle-shaped armatures was significantly lower than that for conventional C-shaped armatures. This implies less energy loss at the rail-armature interface and potentially less lateral force generated during contact arcing},

abstract = {SSPAs are largely used in Navigation and Telecom satellites. Some Payloads may require more than 100 off SSPAs. In this case, most of the payload power is used to supply these SSPAs. EPCs (Electronic Power Conditioner) supplying these SSPAs are then high performance DC/DC converters. Mass and efficiency are the 2 drivers for these DC/DC converters as they could be numerous on a satellite. Usually, these EPCs were presented as modules outside of the SSPA. It has appeared that some mass can be saved if the EPC could be implemented in the same chassis as the SSPA. This paper details the solutions developed for a 60W EPC to be delivered as a PCB without mechanical frame. Parts are selected to cope with thermal management of the PCB embedded in the SSPA host chassis. EPC switching frequency has been optimized to reduce losses without increasing too largely the size of the filtering elements. The main performances achieved by this 60W EPC are detailed and illustrated by measurements recorded on one EM board.},

abstract = {High penetration of wind generation will increase the requirement for fast frequency response services as currently wind plants do not provide inertial response. Although the importance of inertia reduction has been widely recognized, its impact on the system scheduling has not been fully investigated. In this context, this paper proposes a novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for stochastic unit commitment that optimizes system operation by simultaneously scheduling energy production, standing/spinning reserves and inertia-dependent fast frequency response in light of uncertainties associated with wind production and generation outages. Post-fault dynamic frequency requirements, rate of change of frequency, frequency nadir and quasi-steady-state frequency are formulated as MILP constraints by using the simplified model of system dynamics. Moreover the proposed methodology enables the impact of wind uncertainty on system inertia to be considered. Case studies are carried out on the 2030 Great Britain system to demonstrate the importance of incorporating inertia-dependent fast frequency response in the stochastic scheduling and to indicate the potential for the proposed model to inform reviews of grid codes associated with fast frequency response and future development of inertia-related market.},

abstract = {C-GEN is a new topology of direct-drive permanent magnet generator being developed at University of Edinburgh. The main benefits are reduced overall system mass and ease of manufacturing, due to the use of an air-cored winding, but with a modular PM rotor consisting of C-core modules. A 15kW rotary prototype has been fitted and tested on a commercially available wind turbine. Initial sizing studies for wind indicate that the C-GEN concept will be up to 50{\%} lighter than conventional iron cored PM direct drive generators [10]. In addition to wind the C-GEN has applications in marine energy converters. The authors are working with four marine developers to investigate the feasibility of C-GEN for their technology. The results from two of those studies will be presented in this paper namely; Aquamarine Oyster device – near shore wave energy converter, Scotrenewables SRTT device – tidal current energy converter. In order to find the most optimum solution for the specific application; electromagnetic, thermal, structural and economical design aspects of the generator are defined and coupled using an analytical design tool. To evaluate different design variations an optimization tool is developed based on genetic algorithm. All these considerations make the optimised generator design a very close optimum solution for the “real-world”.},

We develop and compare two algorithms for optimally supplying renewable power to time-flexible electricity loads in the presence of a spot market, backward dynamic programming and approximate dynamic programming. We describe how our proposition compares to price responsive demand in terms capacity gains and energy market revenues for renewable generators, and we determine the optimal capacity of deferrable demand which can be reliably coupled to renewable generation.},

abstract = {The flux-switching permanent-magnet (FSPM) motor has been viewed as a highly reliable machine with both armature windings and magnets on the stator. Owing to the high torque-production capability with low torque ripple, FSPM motors with a higher number of phases are potential candidates for traction applications in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). However, existing research has mostly focused on the principles and static performance of multiphase FSPM motors, and little attention has been paid to advanced control strategies. In this paper, the fully decoupled current control of a 36/34-pole nine-phase FSPM (NP-FSPM) motor is developed and the performance under different operating conditions is investigated. The aim of the design is to alleviate cross coupling effects and unwanted low-order stator harmonic currents, to guarantee fast transient response and small steady-state error. In addition, its fault-tolerance is further elaborated. These features are very important in automotive applications where low torque pulsation, high fault-tolerant capability and high dynamic performance are of major importance. Firstly, the research status of multiphase FSPM motors is briefly reviewed. Secondly, the mathematical model in the dq reference frames and control strategies are presented. Then, the control and performance of the NP-FSPM motor are evaluated by using MATLAB/Simulink. Finally, experiments on an NP-FSPM motor prototype are carried out to validate the study.},

The integrated motor design was targeted at pump and fan applications where the need to install motor drives in a separate location is often an impediment to the replacement of fixed speed motors. In order to achieve this objective the thermal and electrical design of the integrated drive have to be considered together. This paper presents the final design that achieves all these objectives, including fully tested and evaluated demonstrations of the power converter and the cooling arrangements. The final integrated motor drive design only differs from a standard motor in terms of one end plate, the terminal box and the shaft driven fan.

To improve drive train availability for applications in electric vehicles, the paper proposes the design of 6-phase permanent magnet machine as two independent 3-phase windings. A number of possible phase shifts between two sets of 3-phase windings due to their slot-pole combination and winding configuration is investigated and the optimum phase shift is selected by analyzing the harmonic distributions and their effect on machine performance including the rotor eddy current losses. The machine design is optimized for a given set of specifications for electric vehicle (EV), under electrical, thermal and volumetric constraints.},

abstract = {To operate motors at a higher efficiency over a wider range of speeds, we have developed a technique that quickly reverses the salient poles in permanent magnet (PM) motors. With this technique, PM motors can change negative salient poles into positive salient poles by applying the magnetization of the PM. Furthermore, we discuss the combi-nation of reversible salient poles with variable magnetic force to increase the efficiency of the motor under partial load. This paper proposes a novel PM motor that uses our proposed technique to reverse saliency and describes the principle of reversible pole saliency as well as the resulting motor characteristics. When the proposed motor operates with a negative salient pole, a higher torque is produced at low speeds; when the motor reverses to a positive salient pole, higher power and efficiency are produced at high speeds. These results confirm that the proposed motor can reverse the saliency direction of the pole and that this reversibility allows the motor to achieve high torque at low speeds and high power at high speeds. Consequently, the motor can operate over a wide range of speeds.},

abstract = {The thesis deals with the issue of cost reduction in direct-drive generators for wind turbines. Today, the combination gearbox-medium-speed (1000-2000 rpm) induction generator largely dominates the market of MW-scale wind turbines. This is due to the lower costs of the gearbox option compared to the costs of gearless systems. Nevertheless, there is an acute interest among researchers and wind turbine suppliers in the possibility of removing gears and slip rings from the drive train, leading to lower maintenance (no oil is required and slip rings can be avoided) and higher reliability due to the absence of wear between gears.$\backslash$nThe direction followed by the thesis is the investigation and comparison of various permanent magnet (PM) machine topologies. The aim is to identify the topology(ies) with the lowest cost/torque and highest torque/ mass. A new TFPM geometry, called TFPM machine with toothed rotor, is derived in the. The new machine topology has the following characteristics: the stator is single-sided, the rotor PM and flux concentrators are independent from the build-up of mechanical tolerances, the installation of rotor parts (PM and flux concentrators) can be automated and the flux circulation allows laminated steel to be used in the stator core. A prototype of the TFPM machine with toothed rotor is presented. $\backslash$nThe comparison between TFPM machines with toothed rotor and conventional PM synchronous machines is discussed. Comparison of the cost/torque and torque/mass of the two machine topologies for diameters ranging between 0.5 m and 3.0 m showed favorable expected performances of the TFPM machine with toothed rotor for diameters of 0.5 m and 1.0 m. However, diameters larger than 1.0 m favored the conventional PM synchronous machine with/without flux-concentration. $\backslash$nUsing the results of the optimization process, the costs of active material are computed for a 1.5 MW wind turbine. It is found that active material represents about 5{\%} of the total turbine cost, while previous estimates indicated that the generator costs are rather between 30{\%} and 40{\%} of a complete direct-drive wind turbine. Therefore, further optimiza{\^{A}}¬tion of direct-drive machines should also include the costs of manufacturing and the costs of the mechanical structure.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the cogging torque caused by manufacturing tolerances through analytical, finite element analysis (FEA), and experimental methods. Based on experiments, it is found that the stator and rotor tolerances of PM motor generate low-frequency components of cogging torque, such as the multiples of rotor pole and stator slot numbers. First, analytical calculation is used to find out the frequency spectrum components of the cogging torque. Then, FEA is used to confirm the analytical results and to determine which tolerances play dominant role on causing these components. Furthermore, the sensitivities of the key tolerances are illustrated. These can provide the designer a direction to design a motor with low sensitivity to tolerances. Because the tolerances of stator and rotor stacks are from stamping die, these tolerances are almost constant. A simple manufacturing method, i.e., rotation lamination, is proposed to manufacture the improved stator and rotor stacks. After using the proposed method, the effects of stator and rotor tolerances are individually validated through experiments. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

In a discrete implementation of the classical DTC scheme, the time delay associated with data processing results in additional torque and flux ripples. This part of the ripples can amount to a significant fraction of the overall ripple if the hysteresis bands are comparable to the maximum torque and flux variations in one sampling interval. This paper presents a prediction scheme with low computational complexity and low parameter sensitivity, both comparable to the standard DTC scheme. The prediction scheme can easily be extended to compensate for multiple time delays when the sampling frequency is raised but the computation time remains unchanged.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In permanent magnet synchronous machine, high-frequency (HF)
signal injection has been extensively investigated for permanent magnet
temperature (PMT) estimation, in which PMT is estimated from the
temperature-dependent HF resistance. Existing studies require prior
knowledge on the HF resistance and neglect the fact that PMT is
temporally correlated. This paper proposes a state-space model for PMT
estimation, in which PMT is modeled with a piecewise linear equation to
explore the temporal correlation. The state-space model is nonlinear due
to unknown model parameters, which is required to be known in existing
studies. This paper proposes to use expectation maximization particle
filter (EM-PF) for simultaneous PMT and model parameter estimation.
After EM-PF estimation, the state-space model becomes linear, so Kalman
filter is employed for online PMT estimation. The proposed EM-PF along
with a Kalman-filter-based approach can explore the temporal correlation
among PMTs to improve the estimation performance, which can be hardly
achieved in existing studies regarding PMT as a time-independent
parameter. It should be noted that EM-PF is for initial PMT and model
parameter estimation, while Kalman filter is for online PMT estimation
ensuring computation efficiency and real-time capability. Our approach
is validated with both numerical and experimental investigations.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new and simple Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control strategy to reduce the torque ripple in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines. The method is based on minimising a cost function that considers the flux linkage torque harmonics obtained from a discrete-time model of the machine. The power converter witching state that minimises this cost function is selected and applied during a whole sampling period. Additionally it is proposed to mitigate the other source of torque ripple, known as cogging-torque, using a feed-forward signal applied to the torque control loop. A hybrid method, that uses the output information from an observer and look-up table, is presented to obtain a good cogging-torque estimation and thus an accurate mitigation of this disturbance torque at low rotational speed. Experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the torque ripple compensation methods presented in this paper.},

As a result, a new generation of power devices is being developed for power converter applications in which traditional Si power devices show limited operation. The use of these new power semiconductor devices will allow both an important improvement in the performance of existing power converters and the development of new power converters, accounting for an increase in the efficiency of the electric energy transformations and a more rational use of the electric energy. At present, SiC and GaN are the more promising semiconductor materials for these new power devices as a consequence of their outstanding properties, commercial availability of starting material, and maturity of their technological processes. This paper presents a review of recent progresses in the development of SiC- and GaN-based power semiconductor devices together with an overall view of the state of the art of this new device generation.},

Therefore, this paper presents a comparative analysis of MMC control techniques, providing a better understanding on how the control techniques impact the fault currents. The analyses were performed by simulating and applying DC faults to a two-terminal VSC-HVDC system with different groups of control techniques. It was found that the DC fault current was not influenced either by control parameters, modulation or output-current control techniques. The arm-balancing control influenced the DC fault currents as it has an impact on the modulation reference signal.},

abstract = { The thermophysical properties of a novel aluminum alloy are investigated. This alloy, GIGAS 30, is appealing for its increased mechanical properties compared to aluminum alloys commonly used for armatures (e.g., Al 6061, 7075). A pulsed current is used to generate the source of thermal loading. A thermocouple is used to measure the temperature rise of the material. The structure to contain the material during the discharge is configured so that very little force loading is generated during the discharge. Hence, the material failure can be essentially characterized from thermal loads alone. Finally, the thermophysical properties measured are used to assess the relative and absolute benefits and burdens when the material is selected for use in designing an integrated launch package for a railgun application. It is found that the marginal increase in breech energy and parasitic mass from the increased resistivity and density is compensated by the increased structural benefits, resulting in slightly increased system efficiency. Moreover, significant insight into material selection can be gained by using the integrated design methodology rather than selection based on one particular material property.},

abstract = {A novel procedure for estimating the total inertia of the Great Britain (GB) power system is presented. Following an instantaneous in-feed loss, regional variations in the estimate of inertia are obtained from measured frequency transients using installed synchronised phasor measurement units (PMUs). A method is proposed to first detect a suitable event for analysis, and then filter the measured transients in order to obtain a reliable estimate of inertia for a given region of the GB network. The total inertia for the whole system is then calculated as a summation, with an estimate also provided as to the contribution to inertia from residual sources, namely synchronously connected demand and embedded generation. The approach is first demonstrated on the full dynamic model of the GB transmission system, before results are presented from analyzing the impact of a number of instantaneous transmission in-feed loss events using phase-angle data provided by PMUs from the GB transmission network and also devices installed at the domestic supply at 4 GB universities.},

The generator is controlled to obtain maximum power from the incident wind with maximum efficiency under different load conditions. Vector control of the grid-side inverter allows power factor regulation of the windmill. This paper shows the dynamic performance of the complete system. Different experimental tests in a 3-kW prototype have been carried out to verify the benefits of the proposed system.},

A polynomial approximation with respect to time is applied to the waveform of the transients in estimating the inertia constant, and a simple model based on the idea of average system frequency is assumed in estimating the capacity of the generators. Results of the estimation using the transients at 10 events show that the inertia constant of the 60 Hz power system of Japan is around 14 to 18 seconds in the system load base, and the capacity of the spinning-reserve support generators is 20 to 40{\%} of the system load.

abstract = {When the wind power accounts for a large portion of the grid power, it may need to help the grid voltage and frequency regulation. This paper investigates a permanent-magnet wind generator with a full power voltage-source converter in weak-grid mode, where the DC-link voltage needs to be controlled from the generator side instead of the grid side. The energy relationship of the wind generator, DC-link energy storage, and load is established. An intrinsic right-half-plane zero, together with the wind power characteristics, the mechanical system inertia, and the DC-link energy storage, is identified as the physical limitations for the control. With the understanding of the system energy relationship and limitations, a hybrid adaptive control algorithm is proposed that searches for the optimal generator acceleration to achieve the maximum wind generator power change rate to match the load power variation. The proposed control scheme is verified through simulation of a 1.5-MW wind system as well as through the experiment of a scaled 1-kW, DSP-/field-programmable-gate-array-controlled, permanent-magnet-generator-based test bed. The results show that it is feasible to regulate DC link by the generator-side converter through the generator speed control. Some important applications issues are also investigated, including the DC-link energy storage requirement, wind speed change impact, and control transition between the weak-grid and strong-grid modes.},

abstract = {This paper describes an experimental platform to emulate the static and dynamic behavior of real Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS). The Wind Turbine Emulator (WTE) consists of two coupled 1.5 kW squirrel-cage induction machines. The WTE calculations are performed on a PC and a DSP, both connected via USB. The total torque applied to the WTE motor is the difference of the scaled wind mechanical torque calculated on the PC, and the turbine inertia torque calculated on the DSP. An improved WTE shaft speed derivative has been used for the inertia torque calculation, which provides better results in terms of attenuation of the high-frequency harmonics present in the generator speed acquisition. The implemented WTE is used to compare different MPPT algorithms and to test power overrating and low voltage ride through procedures.},

abstract = {This paper presents a review of recently used direct torque and flux control (DTC) techniques for voltage inverter-fed induction and permanent-magnet synchronous motors. A variety of techniques, different in concept, are described as follows: switching-table-based hysteresis DTC, direct self control, constant-switching-frequency DTC with space-vector modulation (DTC-SVM). Also, trends in the DTC-SVM techniques based on neuro-fuzzy logic controllers are presented. Some oscillograms that illustrate properties of the presented techniques are shown.},

@article{Diaz2009,
abstract = {In this paper, the sensorless control of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) for wind turbine applications is presented. This kind of generator has many advantages, such as: high efficiency, high power density and low maintenance requirements. To improve these characteristics in the whole wind generator system a sensorless scheme is proposed, thereby avoiding problems of electromagnetic interferences and failures in the position sensor. Usually, in wind drive system, the generator is not operated a very low speeds, therefore problems related to low back-emf for flux estimation in sensorless strategies are avoided. The sensorless scheme proposed here is based on a synchronous d-q frame phase- locked loop (PLL) for back-emf estimation, as those used in voltage phase detection for grid connected converters. The wind turbine control includes maximum power point tracking (MPPT) using the method usually referred in the literature as indirect speed control (ISC). The principle of this method is the regulation of the generator torque as function of rotor speed such that the steady state operation is at the MPPT. This strategy normally requires the knowledge of the shaft speed to determinate the reference torque and rotor position for the orientation of the vector torque control of the PMSG. To achieve both, speed and position estimation, the sensorless technique based in back-emf estimation is proposed. Also in this paper, a laboratory set-up is described. The experimental bench is composed by a squirrel cage induction machine used as wind turbine emulator and the permanent magnet generator. A control program uses a simulated wind profile and gives the speed reference for the induction machine drive, considering the turbine torque production and the inertia of the system. Experimental results to verify the sensorless MPPT of the PMSG are obtained using this wind turbine emulator.},

@article{Van2015,
abstract = {This paper proposes a control scheme of back-to-back PWM converters for the permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) wind turbine system. The DC-link voltage can be controlled at the machine-side converter (MSC), while the grid-side converter (GSC) controls the grid active power for a maximum power point tracking (MPPT). At the grid fault condition, the DC-link voltage controller is designed using a feedback linearization (FL) theory. For the MPPT, a proportional control loop is added to the torque control to reduce the influence of the inertia moment in the wind turbines, which can improve its dynamic performance. The validity of this control algorithm has been verified by the simulation of the 2-MW PMSG wind turbine system.},

@article{Mauricio2009a,
abstract = {This paper presents a new method to enhance the participation of variable-speed wind energy conversion systems (WECS) in existing frequency regulation mechanisms. The proposed approach, based on a modified inertial control scheme, takes advantage of the fast response capability associated with electronically-controlled WECS, allowing the kinetic energy stored by rotational masses to be partly and transiently released in order to provide earlier frequency support. An additional improvement is achieved by communicating the WECS response to conventional generators so that these can eventually take care of the full load imbalance. Several simulations using a two-area test system are performed to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed scheme.},
