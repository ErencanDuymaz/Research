\section{VARIABLE SPEED PMSG WIND TURBINES}

The share of variable speed PMSG wind turbines is increasing worldwide due to the high efficiency and torque density. This type of wind turbines are equipped with full-scale power electronics which enable the turbine to have wide speed range. Even though the permanent magnet price fluctuates with time, the reliability and high efficiency of this type of turbine increase its share in the market. \\
