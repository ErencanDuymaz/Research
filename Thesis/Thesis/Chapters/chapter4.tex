\chapter{INVESTIGATION OF INERTIAL SUPPORT PRACTICAL LIMITS}
\label{chp:4}
The wind turbines are expected to participate frequency regulating mechanisms in the near future. However, their full capacity for fast frequency response is unknown. This chapter focuses the inertial support practical limits to explore the wind turbine potential under different wind speed scenarios.
\section{Inertial Support Limits}
\label{sec:klimit}
The source of the power in a wind turbine is the aerodynamic wind power, $P_{wind}$ which is constant for a constant wind speed, pitch angle and generator speed. In the steady state, this power is transferred through MSC as $P_{gen}$. If there is a difference between $P_{wind}$ and $P_{gen}$, the difference is either stored in or extracted from the turbine and generator inertia as in the form of kinetic energy. Grid power, $P_{grid}$ is received from MSC and injected grid. The difference between $P_{gen}$ and $P_{grid}$ is stored in or extracted from DC-bus capacitance. The active power flow diagram is depicted in Fig. \ref{power_flow}. \par
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{power_flow.pdf}
	\caption{Active Power Flow Diagram}
	\label{power_flow}
\end{figure}
As mentioned in Chapter \ref{chp:3}, stored energy exists in turbine and generator inertia and DC-bus capacitance. However, it is also stated that the $E_{kin}$ is much larger than $E_{DC}$ even in the lowest generator speed. Therefore, the source of additional power in the inertial support studies is the kinetic energy stored in the equivalent turbine inertia. Besides, the DC-bus voltage cannot be decreased below a threshold value that is dependent on the grid phase-to-neutral voltage. Therefore, the energy stored in DC-link capacitor is not utilized in this study.\par
Wind turbine active power can be increased by increasing the generator power $P_{gen}$ as long as that power is successfully injected to grid . This can be achieved by adjusting the generator torque since the active power is proportional to electromagnetic torque. However, the active power is also dependent on the generator rotational speed as in Eq. (\ref{genpower}). The active power can be increased by increasing the turbine torque but the increase is limited by the generator speed. Therefore, the active power increase is also dependent on the wind speed which determines MPPT speed in the steady state.
\begin{equation}
P_{gen}=T_{e} \omega_{m}
\label{genpower}
\end{equation}
It is should be noted that the source of the additional power is the kinetic energy stored in the turbine equivalent inertia. Therefore, as soon as the power is increased, the turbine and generator speeds start decreasing. According to Eq. (\ref{genpower}), the electromechanical torque should be increased steadily to keep the generator power constant. As a result, the support time duration, the increase in the active power and the initial generator speed will determine the final generator speed as in the Eq. (\ref{finalspeed}).\par
\begin{equation}
 \int_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}}P_{wind}- \int_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}}P_{gen}=\Delta E_{kin}=\frac{1}{2}J_{total}(\omega_{f}^2-\omega_{i}^2)
\label{finalspeed}
\end{equation}
As seen from the Eq. (\ref{genpower}), the generator power is the multiplication of generator torque and speed. In the high speeds, the generator speed $\omega_{m}$, cannot be controlled with only the generator torque but also with the pitch angle. In this way, the rated power is not exceeded as in the Eq. (\ref{maxpower}) by keeping turbine at the maximum generator speed, $\omega_{max}$ and the maximum torque $T_{P-lim}$ that is the torque limiting the turbine output power to rated active power. However, general practice is employing higher power rating converter than generator active power rating in the variable speed wind turbines \cite{Muljadi2012}.  Therefore, higher limit torque, $T_{S-lim}$ can be used in such wind turbine applications by considering the apparent power of the back-to-back converters. Therefore, the maximum power for a wind speed can be defined as in Eq. (\ref{maxxpower}).
\begin{equation}
P_{rated}=T_{P-lim} \omega_{max}
\label{maxpower}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P_{max}=T_{S-lim} \omega_{max}
\label{maxxpower}
\end{equation}
It is obvious that the maximum available active power is dependent on the generator speed, hence, the wind speed for the corresponding operation time. This is why the amount of the active power increase also depends on the wind speed. By considering the MPPT speed operation in GE 2.75-103 model variable speed wind turbine, the maximum increase in the active power is shown in Fig. \ref{increase_active_power}. The wind turbine can increase its active power by the lowest amount when the wind speed is high. Since the turbine output power is already close to converter maximum power rating, the increase in the active power is much lower than that of low wind speed operations. It is observed that the wind turbine output power can be increased by 1.3MW (0.43pu) when the wind speed is between 5m/s and 8m/s. \par

	\caption{Accessible Active Power Output for Varying Wind Speeds}
	\label{increase_active_power}
\end{figure}
It is already stated that power system frequency is a function of the input mechanical power of conventional synchronous generators and the output active powers. Therefore, frequency disturbances occur due to the imbalance between these. Since the aim of providing inertial support in the form of fast increased active power is to arrest the frequency decline, the increase in the output power is much more important than the total active output power.

\section{Probabilistic Approach for Fast Inertial Support}
In the Section \ref{sec:klimit}, the inertial support limits are investigated for different wind speeds. It is stated that the wind turbines can increase their active power outputs by highest amounts in the low and medium wind speeds. In order to increase the meaningfulness of such support, probability of different wind speeds is studied. Wind speed measurements used in this thesis are taken from a real wind farm with GE 2.75-103 model wind turbines between 01/01/2017 and 21/08/2017. The variation of the wind speed in the side is depicted in Fig. \ref{windvariation}.\par
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.\linewidth]{windspeeds.png}
	\caption{Variation of the Wind Speed in the Site}
	\label{windvariation}
\end{figure}
Probability density function (PDF) of the measurements is given in Fig. \ref{windpdf}. The wind speed measurements have a mean of 7.13 with a standard deviation of 3.85.\par
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{pdf_wind.pdf}
	\caption{Probability Density Function of Measured Wind Speeds}
	\label{windpdf}
\end{figure}
For a defined wind speed, the active power increase can be calculated by considering the Section \ref{sec:klimit}. However, likelihood of such an increase can be calculated by integrating PDF over desired the wind speed range.\par
It is obvious that the turbine can increase its output by an amount between 10\% and 48\% depending on the wind speed. However, the average inertial support from a wind turbine is another important property for testing the reliability of the support. By utilizing the wind speed measurements and the possible increase in the active output power, it is possible to define availability of the wind turbine for a possible inertial support. In other words, the increase in the active power can be united with the probability of the corresponding speed. In this way, the contribution from different wind speeds is obtained. The net power contribution for varying wind speed is given in the Fig. \ref{net_contribution}.\par
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{netcontribution.pdf}
	\caption{Distribution of Fast Inertial Support}
	\label{net_contribution}
\end{figure}
Since Fig. \ref{net_contribution} is basically product of the pdf given in Fig. \ref{windpdf} and the increase in the active power given in Fig. \ref{increase_active_power}, the area under the graph gives average contribution from a wind turbine by considering the probability of the each wind speed measurement. Therefore, it can be concluded that the average contribution of wind turbine studied in this study is 0.3pu. This contribution is found by the area under the Fig. \ref{increase_active_power}.\par
Moreover, the net contribution when the wind speed is below 3m/s is zero since the turbine is in the cut-off. The probability of the cut-off according to wind speed measurements is found out as 14.16\%. The main contribution concentrates inside the wind speed range between 3m/s and 10m/s that is shown with a dashed arrow inside Fig. \ref{increase_active_power}. Due to the fact that this wind speed range has both higher probability and higher increase capability, the main contribution is provided inside this range. Meanwhile, the higher speed range has relatively lower contribution due to its lower probability and lower capability. \par

\section{Fast Inertial Support Under Different Wind Speeds}
Active power of the wind turbines is determined by parameters such as wind speed, pitch angle and turbine speed. Therefore, combination of these parameters have importance for a possible fast inertial support. In other words, wind turbine under high wind scenario has different potential than that under low wind scenario. Likewise, the resultant states of wind turbines for inertial support would be much different. In this section, the effect of wind speeds will be investigated for fast inertial support. Active power of wind turbines will be increased by different percentages independent of the grid frequency in the fastest way. Turbine internal parameters such as the change in generator speed, turbine and generator torques and pitch angle, if any, will be observed. \par
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.85\linewidth]{rotspeed.pdf}
	\caption{Variation of the Rotational Speed}
	\label{rotspeed}
\end{figure}
The rotational speed for varying wind speed is given in the Fig. \ref{rotspeed}. The minimum and maximum generator speeds exist between the 3m/s and 10m/s wind speeds. The Eq. (\ref{kinetic}) can be used to find out the rotational energy according to the wind speed.\par
\begin{equation}
E_{kinetic}=\frac{1}{2}J_{total}\omega_{m}^{2}
\label{kinetic}
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.85\linewidth]{storedenergy.pdf}
	\caption{Variation of the Rotational Energy}
	\label{rotenergy}
\end{figure}
The rotational energy is shown in the Fig. \ref{rotenergy}. The wind turbine stores almost 18MJ kinetic energy when the wind speed is above 10m/s. However, it stores 0.9MJ energy in the minimum generator speed. This energy can be extracted for the inertial support. However, a part of this energy is reserved for successful operation of the system such that the turbine speed deviation is limited as 30\% \cite{Wu2014}. The available energy that can be used in the inertial support is shown in Fig. \ref{rotenergy} as the difference between the stored energy and reserved energy. \par
Even though 9MJ rotational energy is available for inertial support in the wind speeds above 10m/s, the turbine cannot increase its output power more than 0.1pu. Therefore, the rotational energy itself is not be meaningful without the converter capability. By considering the turbine capability for inertial support, the maximum support duration is found for the maximum power capability in the Fig. \ref{duration}. The support duration is limited with 1 second in the lowest wind speed 3m/s meanwhile the support can be sustained permanently in the wind speeds above 10.8m/s.\par 
In the following sections, wind turbine inertial supports will be investigated by considering the high, medium and low wind speed scenarios. In the each scenario, the wind turbine power will be increased to its maximum value according to the converter capability. The duration of the support is selected as 1 second since support duration of 1 second is achievable for all wind speeds as given in Fig. \ref{duration}. Moreover, the wind turbine active power is increased by 10\% for longer time durations (5, 10 and 20 seconds). The turbine internal dynamics will be investigated under in the limit and moderate cases of each wind speed scenario.
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{duration.pdf}
	\caption{Maximum Support Duration of Inertial Support in the Limit Case}
	\label{duration}
\end{figure}
\subsection{High Wind Scenario}
In this section, wind turbine operation with 11.4m/s wind speed is investigated. The high wind scenario is much different than the low and medium wind speed scenarios. Firstly, the wind turbine injects its maximum power, $P_{rated}$ to grid. Secondly, the generator reference speed is the maximum allowable speed, $\omega_{max}$ which implies that wind turbine operation is away from MPPT operation. In order to keep the generator in the maximum available speed, the pitch angle is used. The reason for using pitch angle is that the generator torque is limited by $T_{P-lim}$. Therefore, the wind turbine decreases turbine power and torque by increasing pitch angle.\par
Wind turbine in the high wind speed scenario has 10\% capacity for active power increase. Therefore, it will increase its output power 10\% both in the limit case (maximum achievable power with short time duration) and the moderate case (small increase in the active power with relatively longer durations).
\subsubsection{Fast Inertial Support Limit in High Wind Scenario}
Wind turbines are able to provide inertial support in high wind speed as long as converter power rating is higher than the wind turbine generator power rating. The wind turbine investigated throughout the study has a converter rating of 3.04MVA meanwhile turbine power rating of 2.75MW. Therefore, active power output can be increased up to 3.04MW during support interval as long as the converter and generator handle excess losses due to overloading. Otherwise, wind turbine cannot provide inertial support for high wind speeds. In the low and medium wind scenarios, the active power can be increased much higher than 10\% in the limit case. However, the limit and moderate fast inertial support cases are the same for high wind speed scenario and limited by 10\%.\par
In the limit cases, the active powers are increased to maximum achievable value and support is sustained for 1 second. However, this time duration is quite short for the high speed scenario since the speed is regulated with the help of pitch angle control. Therefore, the support duration in the high wind speed scenario is selected as 5 seconds. The generator power and torque are shown in Fig. \ref{high_powers}. The generator torque is increased from 1pu to 1.1pu. The increase in the torque rises the power to the maximum allowed power rating. \par
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{s5_powertorque.png}
	\caption{Fast Inertial Support Active Power Limit for High Wind Scenario}
	\label{high_powers}
\end{figure}
The active power of the wind turbine can be increased by increasing the generator torque. Since the turbine torque is constant, turbine speed starts decreasing. However, the turbine torque in the high speed scenario is curtailed with the pitch angle. Therefore, a decrease in the generator speed creates a decrease in the pitch angle. Thus, in the high wind speed scenario, generator speed decrease will be arrested by the turbine torque. \par
Turbine and generator powers and generator speed are shown in Fig. \ref{high_limit_speed}. The
turbine power in this case rises with the inertial support that is different than low
and medium wind scenarios. Moreover, the speed starts decreasing with the support.
However, as the generator speed declines below the maximum generator speed,
pitch angle of the turbine blades decreases which arrests the decrease in the generator
speed. Furthermore, since the speed is below the maximum generator speed during support period, the pitch angle controller decreases the pitch angle causing an increase in the turbine torque. Therefore, the turbine torque goes slightly above 1.1pu and results in a small acceleration in the generator speed. \par
The variation of the pitch angle and the rate of change of pitch angle is shown in Fig. \ref{pitch_rate}. The pitch angle is decreased from $1.4^{\circ}$ to $0.8^{\circ}/$ that avoids the speed decrease in the generator. Therefore, the fast inertial support in the high speed scenario does not require speed recovery since the speed is close to the pre-support speed. The pitch rate in the beginning of inertial support reaches to $0.8^{\circ}/s$ that is below the maximum allowable pitch rate of $5-10^{\circ}/s$ \cite{Ackermann2005a}. \par

	\includegraphics[width=1 \linewidth]{high_pitch_rate_2.png}
	\caption{Pitch Angle and Rate of Change of Pitch Angle for High Wind Limit Scenario}
	\label{pitch_rate}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Moderate Inertial Support Limit in High Wind Scenario}
In this part, the active power of the wind turbine is increased again by 10\% with three different time intervals. The active powers are shown in Fig. \ref{high_powerss}.\par
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{high_powers_5_10_20.png}
	\caption{Active Power Output of the Wind Turbine for High Wind Scenario}
	\label{high_powerss}
\end{figure}
An interesting observation in high wind scenario is that there is no speed recovery process. As soon as the speed is decreased, the pitch controller decreases the blade angle which causes an increase in turbine torque. Therefore, in this case, turbine power decreases back to normal rather than a lower power value as in the other scenarios. In the high wind scenario, the generator torque hits the limit defined for normal operating conditions. This is why generator speed is regulated with the help of blade angle. Therefore, pitch angle is also important in this section. \par
Generator speed, turbine and generator torques as well as pitch angle for 20 seconds support case are shown in Fig. \ref{high_s20}. Notice that pitch servo acts slower than the generator torque increase time. This is why the generator speed decreases until the pitch angle is decreased. Generator speed might not be disturbed if the pitch controller is able act fast enough.\par
After the generator speed is arrested within 2 seconds by the pitch angle, generator speed starts rising towards the maximum generator speed. If the support time is increased, the generator speed will reach the maximum speed, and will stay constant with a new pitch angle. This means that the turbine is able to provide the support forever. However, the full capacity of the converter cannot be used permanently since it causes  overloading of the converters in the wind turbine and excess heat losses. \par

	\caption{Pitch Angle and Rate of Change of Pitch Angle for High Wind Scenario for 20 Seconds Support}
	\label{high_pitch}
\end{figure}
The pitch angle variation and the rate of change of pitch angle is given in Fig. \ref{high_pitch}. Rate of change of blade angle in the beginning of inertial support reaches to $0.8^{\circ}/s$ as in the limit case.
\subsection{Low Wind Scenario}
\label{sec:lowwind}
The minimum speed of the wind turbine generator in this scenario is 550 rpm (4.7 rpm in the rotor). Wind speed that will capture the maximum power from wind in this generator speed is found out to be 3.12m/s. In this scenario, the kinetic energy stored in the turbine inertia is minimum as calculated in Eq. (\ref{kineticenergymin}). This scenario investigates the case where the least amount of kinetic energy exists in the turbine equivalent inertia. By the fast inertial support provision, the wind turbine speed decreases below the minimum generator speed. However, the resultant minimum generator speed is dependent on the increase in the active power and also the support interval.
\subsubsection{Fast Inertial Support Limit for the Low Wind Scenario}
The electricity grid in the upcoming future might require sudden active power release from wind farms for short time durations to arrest steepest frequency declines. Therefore, it is important to observe the maximum achievable power for inertial support studies. The equation Eq. (\ref{maxxpower}) implies that wind turbine in the low wind speed scenario cannot reach rated power since the generator speed is much lower than the maximum generator speed. However, the electromechanical torque in steady state is much lower than the limit torque, $T_{S-lim}$. Therefore, the wind turbine in low speed scenario has the potential for increasing its active power by 0.32pu.\par
Fig. \ref{low_limit_power} shows the active power, output torque and the speed of the generator. The increase in the active power is obtained by ensuring the limit torque, $T_{S-lim}$. In this way, wind turbine can achieve a power value of 0.35pu in the limit case. However, since the generator speed is decreasing, the active power is also decreasing due to the fact that further increase in the generator torque is not possible. \par
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{low_2000.png}
	\caption{Fast Inertial Support Active Power Limit for Low Wind Scenario}
	\label{low_limit_power}
\end{figure}
The support duration is chosen as 1 second according to the available kinetic energy utilization. Even in this short duration, the generator speed declines by 25\%. It should be noted that turbine might stall if the support duration is extended. \par
\subsubsection{Moderate Fast Inertial Support for the  Low Wind Scenario}
Wind turbines are able to increase its power by 0.32pu even in the low wind speed scenario. However, the time interval is kept as 1 second possible in order to be kept within the available kinetic energy limit. Nonetheless, the longer support periods can be achievable if the increase in the active power is decreased. Therefore, in this part, the active power of the wind turbine is increased by 10\% for three different time intervals as 5, 10 and 20 seconds. The active power output of the wind turbine is given in Fig. \ref{lowactivepowers}. It is observed that turbine power decreases below the nominal value after the support period in order to recover the generator speed. Another observation is the fact that higher support time creates higher dip in the active power in the speed recovery period.\par
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{lowpowers2.png}
	\caption{Active Power Output of the Wind Turbine for Low Wind Scenario}

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{lowspeeds2.png}
	\caption{Generator Speeds of the Wind Turbine for Low Wind Scenario}
	\label{low_speeds}
\end{figure}
Generator speed decreases continuously until the support is ended. The generator speeds are shown in Fig. \ref{low_speeds} for three support scenarios. The decrease in the generator speed is obtained with an increase in the generator torque. The turbine torque, generator torque and generator speed for 5 seconds support duration is given in Fig. \ref{low_torques}. The generator torque is increased at t=10s for a time duration of 5 seconds. Turbine torque increases slightly with decreasing speed. However, the increase in the turbine torque is negligible when it is compared to the increase in generator torque. Therefore, the turbine torque can be considered to be constant for the support period meanwhile the generator torque is increased. Wind speed in this scenario decreases 1.6\%. Turbine and generator torque for 20 second case is also shown in Fig. \ref{low_torques3} in which speed decreases by 4.8\%.\par

\end{figure}
\subsection{Medium Wind Scenario}
In the medium wind scenario, wind turbine is operated in 6m/s wind speed. This corresponds to the generator speed of 110.8rad/s (9rpm rotor speed). Wind turbine in the medium wind speed range can increase its power by 1.32MW for fast inertial support as stated in the Section \ref{sec:klimit}. Even though the wind turbine has lower kinetic energy than that of high wind scenario, it can reach higher active power values due to its higher MPPT speed. 
\subsubsection{Fast Inertial Support Limit for the Medium Wind Scenario}
It is already mentioned that wind turbines in the medium wind speed scenario can increase its power more than that of low wind speed scenario. The reason is the dependency of the active power on the generator speed. The active power limit in the medium wind speed scenario is given in Fig. \ref{medium_limit_power}. The wind turbine active power is increased by 1.32MW as expected in the Fig. \ref{increase_active_power}.\par
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{power_torque_medium_limit_2.png}
	\caption{Fast Inertial Support Active Power Limit for Medium Wind Scenario}
	\label{medium_limit_power}
\end{figure}
 Generator speed decreases due to increased generator power while the turbine power is almost constant. Since the turbine leaves the MPP point, the turbine power declines. However, the change in the turbine power is small. Therefore, the turbine power is said to be constant for this interval. 
\subsubsection{Moderate Fast Inertial Support for the Medium Wind Scenario}
Fast inertial support with a duration of 1 second can be evolved to moderate inertial support with longer duration of support as 5, 10 and 20 seconds and small increase in active power. Therefore, the active power of the wind turbine is increased by 10\% and it is shown in Fig. \ref{midpowers} for three different time intervals. The recovery period of shortest support case is much more smoother than the longer ones. When the support time is increased, active power of the wind turbine is almost halved that might cause also problems in frequency stability of the power systems. \par
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{medium_powers_2.png}
	\caption{Active Power Output of the Wind Turbine for Medium Wind Scenario}
	\label{midpowers}
\end{figure}
In medium wind scenario, higher support time causes decreased active power after the support. The reason is the lower speed value obtained with higher support time. Generator torque is decreased much higher for this case in order to recover the speed. The generator speed, turbine and generator torques are shown in Fig. \ref{mid_torques3}. After the support, MPPT algorithm takes action and regulates the speed correspondingly. Therefore, the generator torque jumped down to lower value to restore the MPPT speed. The negative jump in generator torque crates a negative jump in the active power of the wind turbine since the transferred power is the multiplication of generator torque and generator speed.\par

\section{Conclusion}
In this section, the wind turbine practical limits are investigated for the inertial support provision. The capability of the wind turbine is revealed based on the different wind speed scenarios. The results has shown that the turbine is able to increase its active power by 0.45pu when the turbine operates in the medium wind speed range (6m/s and 8m/s). The turbine capability decreases down to 0.1pu additional power when the turbine operates in the high wind speed range which is above the 10m/s.\par
Another conclusion of this chapter is the fact that the studied wind turbine is appropriate for inertial support provision. The internal turbine parameters such as generator torque and active power are kept inside the operational limits inside the support duration. In the high wind speeds, the pitch angle controller first decreases the blade angle as the generator speed decreases. The blade angle is increased after support duration. During these transitions, rate of change of pitch angle is kept inside the operational limits. The maximum pitch angle rate is $0.8^{\circ}/s$ that is much below the maximum pitch angle rate limit of $10^{\circ}/s$ \cite{Ackermann2005a}.\par
Finally, it is shown that the wind turbines can increase its active power up to 0.45pu during the 1 second support duration. Meanwhile, the support duration can be increased up to 30 seconds as the support power is decreased to 10\%. The fast inertial support is provided to grid with an amount independent from the grid frequency. The active power can be increased 20ms after the support command. The fast injection of the active power might decrease the initial RoCoF following a frequency disturbance. However, the grid frequency might be subjected to a second dip when the inertial support is ceased. This is another shortcoming of the fast inertial support and might cause another frequency disturbance in weak power systems. \par
The fast inertial support is independent of the grid frequency. However, the increase in the active power can be a function of the frequency behavior as in the case of synthetic inertia. In the Chapter \ref{chp:5}, the inertial support proportional to RoCoF will be investigated.
