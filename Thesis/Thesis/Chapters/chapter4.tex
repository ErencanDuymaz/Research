\chapter{INERTIAL SUPPORT UNDER DIFFERENT WIND SPEEDS}
\label{chp:4}
Active power of the wind turbines is determined by parameters such as wind speed, pitch angle and turbine speed. Therefore, combination of these parameters have importance for a possible inertial support. In other words, wind turbine under high wind scenario has different potential than that under low wind scenario. Likewise, the resultant states of wind turbines for inertial support would be much different. In this chapter, the effect of wind speed will be investigated for inertial support. Active power of wind turbines will be increased by 10\% for different time durations. The change in generator speed, turbine and generator torques, DC-link voltage and pitch angle, if any, will be observed. Wind turbine used in this study is GE 2.75-103 model, variable speed PMSG.

\section{Low Wind Scenario}
\label{sec:lowwind}

The minimum speed of the wind turbine generator in this scenario is 550 rpm in the high speed side. Wind speed that will capture the maximum power from wind is found out to be 3.12m/s. In this scenario, the kinetic energy stored in the turbine inertia is minimum and calculated in Chapter \ref{chp:4} in Eq. (\ref{kineticenergymin}). This scenario investigates the case where the least amount of energy exists in the turbine equivalent inertia.
