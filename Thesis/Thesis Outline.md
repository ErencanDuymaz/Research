**Chapter 1**  
This chapter will review the share of renewable sources, upcoming renewable source share in the future and the problems coming with it i.e. decrease in the aggravated grid inertia. 

**Chapter 2**  
In this chapter, synthetic inertia concept can be reviewed. The literature will be summarized. Drawbacks or missing points in the papers can be addressed. Moreover, synthetic inertia implementation for PMSG wind turbines can be expressed in detail. 

   
**Chapter 3**  
Inertial support for GE 2.75 MW PMSG WT model can be shown in detail. Assumption for the corresponding model can be listed (this might also appear in appendix). 
Its response to a frequency disturbance in a simulation environment can be shown. 
The inertial support can be given with different inertia constants.
    
**Chapter 4**  
Inertial support of WT on a grid. This grid might be Turkish Power System or another test case. For the high or low wind cases, the resultant improvements in a simulation environment can be demonstrated.  


**Chapter 5**  
*Wind Turbine Emulator* for the 2.75 PMSG WT. Power, Speed, Inertia scale will be evaluated for the existing WTE. 
WTE grid simulator connection will be established and test cases (these test cases will be both load connection but under high and low wind scenarios) will be tested in the WTE-Grid Simulator test rig. This chapter will verify the improvements found to be in the simulation environment. 

**Chapter 6**  
This chapter will propose interleaved inertial support for the wind farms. Different interleaved inertial supports will be tested for different frequency deviations on the simulation environment.
