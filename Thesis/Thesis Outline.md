**Chapter 1**  
This chapter will review the share of renewable sources, upcoming renewable source share in the future and the problems coming with it i.e. decrease in the aggravated grid inertia. 

**Chapter 2**  
In this chapter, synthetic inertia concept can be reviewed. The literature will be summarized. Drawbacks or missing points in the papers can be addressed. Moreover, synthetic inertia implementation for PMSG wind turbines can be expressed in detail. 

Missing Skills: Drive working principles, PI compensator tuning, PI constants in a drive  
   
**Chapter 3**  
Inertial support for GE 2.75 MW PMSG WT model can be shown in detail. Assumption for the corresponding model can be listed (this might also appear in appendix). 
Its response to a frequency disturbance in a simulation environment can be shown.  
    
**Chapter 4**  
Inertial support of WT on a grid. This grid might be Turkish Power System or another test case. For the high or low wind cases, the resultant improvements in a simulation environment can be demonstrated.  

Missings: A proper simulation model  

**Chapter 5**  
*Wind Turbine Emulator* for the 2.75 PMSG WT. Power, Speed, Inertia scale will be evaluated for the existing WTE. If it is not appropriate, different inertia staged motor test bench will be evaluated for such employment. 

**Chapter 6**  
Grid simulator in TÃ¼bitak (or the one to be purchased) will be employed in a test case. WTE grid simulator connection will be established and test cases (this test cases will be both load connection but under high and low wind scenarios) will be tested in the WTE-Grid Simulator test rig. This chapter will verify the improvements found to be in the simulation environment. 

**Chapter 7**  
In this chapter, the results will be reconsidered. Economical impacts can be investigated. Extreme cases (60-70% Wind Turbine Share) can be tested under frequency stability criteria. It can be concluded that sustainability of the system under such extreme cases can be maintained with the help of inertial support of WTs.
