One of the most important requirement of an electric grid is the constant frequency. Grid operators has to maintain grid frequency between predetermined values. Frequency in a electric grid depends on the balance between generation and the demand and changes according to the swing equation.

According to the swing equation, frequency in a grid decreases if the generated power is less than the consumed power. This occurs with either load connection or generally with sudden generator outage. As soon as this power inequality is experienced in the grid, frequency starts to deviate from the nominal value. The difference power is supplied from the kinetic energy stored in the turbine inertia.

As seen from the Figure above, the frequency falls rapidly due to an event occuring in the point O. Here, rate of change of frequency depends on basically the total inertia of the grid. The lower inertia the grid has, the steepest falls the frequency. However, the frequency nadir is dependent on the grid inertia and also the governor action of the conventional synchronous generators. The fall in the frequency is arrested with both inertia of the grid and the governor action. As soon as the governor action is completed, the grid frequency is stabilized. However, the frequency would be still far away from the nominal value. In order to frequency restore, the secondary controllers should act and push frequency to higher values by producing more power than the consumed power.  

Inertial support has huge importance on frequency stability.Rate of change of frequency is determined by the synchronous generator inertial support. This is achieved by the "inherently" by synchronous generators due to the fact that they rotate with synchronous speed and this speed is grid frequency dependent. As the grid frequency decreases, the synchronous speed also decreases which will slow down the generator resulting with the extraction of the kinetic energy.
