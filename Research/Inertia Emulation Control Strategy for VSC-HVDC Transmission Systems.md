#Summary 

VSC-HVDC transformers are deliberately used for isolating interconnected systems from propagation of the transients. This paper presents a novel inertia emulation control INEC which enables system with HVDC transformer to provide support which imitates the inertia of the synchronous generator (SG). The control scheme INEC with VSC-HVDC transfomer with fixed capacitance emulates a wide range of inertia constant H by specifying the an amount of DC voltage variation. The main logic here is decreasing the DC voltage stored in the fixed capacitance so that transformer secondary side increase its active power without changing the active power flow from primary side to the secondary side. The increased active power is achieved by the change of stored energy in the capacitor.
