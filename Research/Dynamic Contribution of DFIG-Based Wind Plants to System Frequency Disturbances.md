**Abstract:** This paper discuss the the contribution of DFIGs to system frequency response. A novel control algorithm is presented for extracting maximum power from a turbine. 

**Summary**  
DFIGs are widely used for their ability to work on variable speeds. Their torque values and therefore active power and the reactive power can be controlled in a fast way. 

Some previous works are reviewed. Their missing points are emphasized. Especially, it is emphasized that the aerodynamics of the turbine is not considered in the inertial response. Moreover, converter current and voltage ratings are not considered in the previous works. 

This paper discusses the key parameters in the inertial response. Also, it presents a kinetic energy extraction algorithm to apply to a variable speed wind turbine.

**Simulation:**  
The simulation is constructed with a 1.5 DFIG WT and 8 MVA diesel generator connected to the same MV bus. The response of the system to a 750 kW load connection is simulated for different governor speeds, inertia and the droop percentages. 

- Governor is slowly acting
- Inertia is greatly influence to ROCOF and minimum frequency point
- Droop does not effect the initial ROCOF but it effects the minimum frequency point. 












**Kuncuklanabilecek noktalar**

- DFIGs have a 20-30 % power converter from their rotor sides. Therefore, they are considered to be contributing to grid inertia with a lower inertia. But, what is their equivalent inertia?
