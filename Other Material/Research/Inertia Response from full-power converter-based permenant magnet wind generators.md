# Inertia Response from full-power converter-based permenant magnet wind generators #
-- 
**Abstract:** This paper investigates different ways of emulating inertia response in full-rated power-based wind turbines equipped with PMSG. This ways are basically depends on additional control signals which will extract the kinetic energy in the rotating mass and the stored energy in the capacitor DC link. 

In this paper two examples have been given to explain the necessity of the inertia emulation for the **system operators**.
